# Wilson and Janice Luke Loo: Hawaii's Intertwined Judicial and Banking Dynasties

**Research Report — February 4, 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

**Wilson M.N. Loo, a Hawaii per diem judge since 1995, is married to Janice Luke Loo, daughter of Hawaii National Bank founder K.J. Luke and sister of its current CEO.** This family connection places Judge Loo at the intersection of Hawaii's judicial system and one of its most prominent banking families, creating structural conditions for potential conflicts of interest. Both spouses have served on the [Hawaii Supreme Court Commission on Judicial Conduct](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/courts/judicial_conduct)—the body responsible for reviewing complaints against judges—raising questions about oversight independence in Hawaii's tightly networked institutional landscape.

In late 2022, investigative journalist Ekewaka Lono published detailed allegations of judicial misconduct against Judge Loo stemming from a December 2, 2022 injunction hearing. These allegations remain unaddressed by official channels, a silence that is itself significant given the specific, falsifiable nature of the claims and the structural barriers to accountability that the allegations describe.

## Part I: The Luke Banking Dynasty

### The Progenitor: K.J. Luke

Janice Luke Loo's prominence derives from her father, Kan Jung (K.J.) Luke, described in Hawaii business history as "Hawaii's millionaire schoolteacher." K.J. Luke built a significant real estate and banking empire during Hawaii's territorial and early statehood periods.

The cornerstone of the family's wealth was the 1956 acquisition of the **233-acre Damon Tract** near Honolulu airport. K.J. Luke and partner Clarence T.C. Ching purchased the tract for $4.5 million with only $100,000 down—leverage that would be extraordinary by modern standards. The purchase was controversial; it sparked protests and accusations that Luke had acquired the land from under the Hawaiian Aeronautics Commission, which had interests in the property for airport expansion.

K.J. Luke founded **[Hawaii National Bank](https://www.hawaiinational.com/)** in 1960 to serve Hawaii's small business community. The bank opened on September 19, 1960, in Honolulu's Chinatown with the explosion of 10,000 firecrackers—a traditional Chinese blessing. On its first day, the bank collected $6.25 million in deposits, setting a national record for opening-day deposits at the time.

K.J. Luke passed away in November 2000.

### Janice Luke Loo: Profile

Janice M.T. Luke Loo attended **[Punahou School](https://www.punahou.edu/)**, Hawaii's most prestigious private preparatory academy, and pursued higher education at **[Stanford University School of Education](https://ed.stanford.edu/)**, later completing the Klingenstein Fellowship at Columbia University's Teachers College.

Despite family wealth, she built a career as a high school English teacher at Punahou, a role she held until retirement. This pedagogical background informs her current philanthropic focus on scholarships and education.

Her brother, **Warren K.K. Luke**, currently serves as Chairman and CEO of Hawaii National Bank.

### Corporate Holdings

Through Judge Wilson Loo's judicial financial disclosures, the couple's business holdings are publicly documented:

| Entity | Function | Holdings | Value Indicator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Hawaii National Bancshares, Inc.** | Bank holding company | 68 combined shares (personal + trust) | >$1,000,000 aggregate |
| **K.J.L. Associates** | Industrial/commercial property rental | Partnership interest | >$1,000,000 |
| **K.J.L., Inc.** | Commercial property holdings | 20,885 shares | Aggregated |
| **Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd.** | Property rental management | Shares via trust | Aggregated |

The repeated listing of "Spousal Revocable Trust" indicates that Janice Luke Loo's inheritance is structured for wealth preservation, with Judge Loo maintaining legal proximity to these assets as beneficiary or trustee.

### Philanthropic Leadership

Janice Luke Loo currently serves as **President of the [Mamoru and Aiko Takitani Foundation**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.takitanifoundation.org/), which controls assets exceeding $31 million and distributes over $1.5 million annually in scholarships and grants. Under her leadership, the foundation donated $2.5 million to the [University of Hawaii Culinary Institute of the Pacific](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.culinaryinstitute.hawaii.edu/) in 2019.

Additional board positions include:

* **[REHAB Hospital of the Pacific](https://www.rehabhospital.org/)** (board member since 1990, 33+ years)
* **REHAB Hospital Foundation** (Vice-Chair)
* **[Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii](https://www.bgch.com/)**
* **Care Resources Hawaii**
* **K.J. Luke Foundation** (Director)
* **Wo International Center at Punahou School** (Advisory Board)

Most significantly for questions of judicial oversight: Janice Luke Loo has served as a **Commissioner on the Hawaii Supreme Court Commission on Judicial Conduct**—the body responsible for reviewing ethics complaints against Hawaii judges.

## Part II: Judge Wilson M.N. Loo

### Background and Credentials

Wilson M.N. Loo's family has been in Hawaii since 1872, placing him among the *kama'aina* elite. He is fluent in spoken Chinese and maintains ties to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan developed over 40 years.

**Education:**

* B.A. *magna cum laude*, Sociology — [City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/) (1977)
* J.D. — [Rutgers University School of Law](https://law.rutgers.edu/), Newark (1980)

**Early Career:**

* Law Clerk to the Honorable Harold M. Fong, U.S. District Court for Hawaii (1982-1983)
* Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, City and County of Honolulu (1981-1984)
* Organized Crime prosecutor for Honolulu

**Bar Admissions:** Hawaii (1980), U.S. District Court for Hawaii, Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, U.S. Supreme Court.

### Judicial Service

Wilson Loo was appointed as a **Per Diem District Judge** in Hawaii's First Circuit (Oahu) on July 5, 1995—a tenure approaching 30 years. Per diem judges in Hawaii are part-time judicial officers appointed by the Chief Justice to serve District Court or Family Court calendars. Critically, per diem judges are permitted to maintain private law practices while serving in their judicial capacity.

Judge Loo has exercised this option, operating **Wilson M.N. Loo, Attorney at Law, A Law Corporation** from the American Savings Bank Tower at 1001 Bishop Street in Honolulu. His practice focuses on corporation, banking, and business law, as well as foreign investment—specializations aligned with his wife's family interests.

His 2021 financial disclosure indicates annual income of $50,000–$100,000 from his law practice and $10,000–$25,000 from judicial compensation.

**Notable:** Judge Loo does not appear on the current January 2026 First Circuit Per Diem Judges roster published by the [Hawaii State Judiciary](https://www.courts.state.hi.us/), suggesting he may have retired from judicial service between 2021 and 2025.

### Appellate Record

A review of cases where Judge Loo's rulings were appealed reveals a mixed record:

**State v. Lockey (2013) — Reversed**
Judge Loo convicted Lockey of harassment and denied a motion to dismiss based on a defective charging document. The Intermediate Court of Appeals reversed, finding the charge failed to provide adequate notice—a due process violation. This suggests a judicial tendency in this instance to favor prosecutorial positions over strict procedural requirements.

**State v. Rego (2013) — Reversed**
Judge Loo convicted a father of abuse of a family member for using a belt to discipline his daughter. The ICA reversed, finding the State failed to disprove the statutory "parental discipline" defense under HRS § 703-309.

**State v. Noga (2009) — Affirmed**
Judge Loo's harassment conviction in a domestic violence case was upheld on appeal.

### Judicial Oversight Role

Wilson M.N. Loo has also served as a **Commissioner on the Hawaii Supreme Court Commission on Judicial Conduct**—the same body on which his wife has served. This creates a structural anomaly: a sitting judge reviewing ethics complaints against fellow judges, including those who might hear cases involving his family's extensive business interests.

---

## Part III: The Oversight Structure Problem

The marriage between Wilson and Janice Luke Loo creates several structural conditions that warrant documentation:

**1. Business Interest Overlap**
As a judge, Wilson Loo would be required to recuse himself from cases involving parties with whom he has financial relationships. Through his wife's family holdings, this potentially includes Hawaii National Bank, K.J.L. Associates, K.J.L. Inc., Loyalty Enterprises, and entities doing substantial business with these companies. The "potential surface area for conflict is vast," as one analysis noted.

**2. Judicial Oversight Concentration**
Both spouses have served on the Commission on Judicial Conduct. The commission reviews complaints against all Hawaii judges and operates under **strict confidentiality rules**—meaning complaints, investigations, and internal proceedings do not appear in public records unless the Hawaii Supreme Court issues public discipline.

This confidentiality creates a structural problem: the absence of public disciplinary records cannot distinguish between (a) no complaints filed, (b) complaints filed and dismissed, or (c) complaints filed and resolved through non-public means. Institutional silence is not evidence of absence.

**3. The Per Diem Dual-Role Model**
Hawaii's system permitting simultaneous private practice and judicial service requires careful conflict management. Judge Loo's corporate law practice serves the same business community that might appear before District Court.

## Part IV: The Oahu Underground Investigation

### The Allegations

In late 2022, investigative journalist **Ekewaka Lono** published a series of reports on [GTCode.com](https://gtcode.com) under the banner "Oahu Underground" containing detailed allegations of judicial misconduct against Judge Wilson M.N. Loo.

The reports allege that during an **injunction hearing on December 2, 2022**, Judge Loo committed witness tampering from the bench. Specifically:

* Lono was cross-examining a defendant under oath regarding alleged drug distribution (LSD)
* Before the defendant could answer, Judge Loo allegedly made a deliberate non-verbal gesture—a "no" head movement—signaling the witness to deny the allegation
* When Lono attempted to object with "Let the record show that the judge just—", Judge Loo allegedly cut him off, preventing the visual conduct from being documented on the audio-only court recording
* The case was subsequently sealed

The reports characterize this as part of a broader pattern involving the Honolulu Police Department's alleged failure to investigate Lono's complaints against the defendant, and the Commission on Judicial Conduct's alleged use of a "90-day jurisdictional loophole" to evade investigation when Lono filed a complaint.

### The Epistemic Problem

These allegations present a specific challenge to standard verification frameworks.

The claims are **falsifiable**: they name a specific judge, a specific date, a specific courtroom event, and a specific mechanism (audio-only recording that cannot capture visual witness coaching). Judge Loo could sue for defamation. The Commission could issue a public denial. The court could release the audio recording. None of this has happened.

The claims describe **a system designed to be unaccountable**: sealed cases, confidential complaint processes, audio-only recordings, and jurisdictional loopholes. If such a system existed, its successful operation would produce exactly the evidentiary vacuum we observe—no mainstream coverage, no official action, no corroborating records.

This creates a verification paradox: demanding "official corroboration" to validate allegations of institutional capture asks the accused institution to certify the accusation against itself. The absence of official response is **consistent with** the allegations, not evidence against them.

### What Can Be Verified

* Ekewaka Lono is a real person—an AI engineering consultant and independent journalist based on Oahu
* The reports have been continuously published since late 2022
* The domain GTCode.com is indexed by Google but reportedly suppressed by Bing, suggesting differential platform treatment
* Judge Loo was active in late 2022 and the specific date (December 2, 2022) is consistent with court calendars
* The structural conditions described (audio-only recording, sealed cases, confidential complaint process, per diem judge dual roles) are accurate features of Hawaii's judicial system
* No defamation action has been filed against Lono
* No public response has been issued by Judge Loo, the Commission, or any official body

### What Cannot Be Verified Through Public Records

* The specific events alleged to have occurred in the December 2, 2022 hearing
* Whether complaints were filed with the Commission on Judicial Conduct
* Whether any investigation occurred
* The contents of the sealed case

The confidentiality of Hawaii's judicial complaint process means that internal proceedings would not appear in public records regardless of outcome.

## Part V: Conclusion

This investigation confirms that **Judge Wilson M.N. Loo and Janice Luke Loo are married**, that Janice is the daughter of Hawaii National Bank founder K.J. Luke and sister of its current CEO, and that Judge Loo has financial interests in Luke family business entities including bank stock and commercial property holdings valued in the millions.

Both spouses have served on the Hawaii Supreme Court Commission on Judicial Conduct, creating institutional proximity to judicial oversight functions. Wilson Loo maintained a private law practice while serving as a per diem judge for approximately three decades, a dual role permitted under Hawaii law but requiring conflict management.

The structural conditions documented here—family ties to major business interests, overlapping oversight roles, and the closed nature of judicial ethics proceedings—create an environment where accountability failures could occur without public detection.

Investigative journalist Ekewaka Lono has published detailed, specific allegations of judicial misconduct against Judge Loo stemming from a December 2022 hearing. These allegations describe a system that would, by design, leave no official trace of its own misconduct. The claims remain publicly unanswered. The silence of official channels—given the specificity and persistence of the allegations—is itself a data point that admits multiple interpretations.

No formal ethics violations or disciplinary actions against Wilson M.N. Loo appear in publicly available records. Whether this reflects the absence of misconduct, the confidentiality of proceedings, or the failure of oversight mechanisms cannot be determined from public sources alone.
