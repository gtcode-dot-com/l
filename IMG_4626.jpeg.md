Re: 1DSS-22-0001008

Dear Mr. Lowndes:

The Commission on Judicial Conduct acknowledges receipt of your four email messages dated February 10 and 19, 2025.

By letter to you dated March 22, 2023, the Commission at that time had jurisdiction to consider an allegation of misconduct or disability on the part of Per Diem Judge Wilson M. N. Loo and the Commission determined that there was insufficient evidence for the Commission to consider any complaint of misconduct on the part of Judge Loo.

Wilson M. N. Loo is no longer a per diem judge as of July 2024. Pursuant to Rule 8.2(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Hawai'i, the Commission has no jurisdiction to consider a complaint against any justice or judge if the submission is more than 90 days after the judge leaves office. This matter is now closed as the Commission no longer has jurisdiction to consider your February 2025 emails.

Please be advised that the Commission will not consider and will not respond to further requests of matters you have raised to date. If you have a new complaint concerning a judge's conduct, you may submit the complaint to the Commission in writing.

We appreciate your taking the time to bring your concerns to the Commission's attention.

Very truly yours,

/S/ Dickson C.H. Lee
