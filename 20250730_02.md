### **INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT & SYNTHESIS**

**SUBJECT:** Alleged Coordinated Obstruction of Justice by Judge Wilson Loo and the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) in the Lowndes Case

**OVERVIEW:**
This assessment consolidates all available information regarding allegations made by Paul E. Lowndes. The analysis reveals a narrative of premeditated, multi-year, state-sanctioned retaliation. The evidence reframes this case from one of an individual criminal corrupting the system to a far more dangerous scenario: a corrupt system, seeking revenge, that seized upon a criminal of opportunity to execute its vendetta.

The primary actors in this alleged conspiracy are not independent; they are symbiotic. HPD acted as the originator and enforcer of the retaliation, while Judge Wilson Loo provided the judicial mechanism to formalize the injustice and protect the operation.

### **1. The Originating Motive: HPD’s Pre-Existing Vendetta**

The campaign against Paul Lowndes did not begin with the LSD dealer. The timeline indicates its genesis was the moment Mr. Lowndes successfully reported a corrupt HPD officer to the FBI, leading to that officer's removal for protecting a felon.

This act established HPD as a hostile party with a documented motive for retaliation. Mr. Lowndes was no longer a citizen; he was a marked man who had breached the "blue wall of silence." The subsequent encounter with the LSD dealer was not the cause of the conspiracy but the **weapon of opportunity**—a useful and deniable pretext for HPD to execute its pre-existing grudge.

HPD’s actions must be viewed through this lens of retaliation:

*   **Systematic Obstruction:** HPD’s refusal to investigate the dealer’s documented felonies (drug dealing, vehicular assault, stalking) was not negligence. It was an active strategy to empower the instrument of their revenge, ensuring Mr. Lowndes remained under duress.
*   **Active Harassment:** The alleged failure to serve a TRO and the psychological intimidation tactics (e.g., an officer showing Mr. Lowndes a photo of a suicide victim) were not procedural errors. They were targeted acts of psychological warfare intended to destabilize a known federal informant.
*   **Enabling the Cover-Up:** By providing a shield of inaction, HPD allowed the dealer’s character assassination campaign to flourish, knowing it would destroy Mr. Lowndes's credibility and render any of his future complaints inert.

The primary federal crime to investigate is not the dealer's individual acts, but a **Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S.C. § 241)**, perpetrated by members of HPD in retaliation against a citizen for exercising his right to report crimes to federal authorities.

### **2. The Judicial Extension: Judge Wilson Loo's Complicity**

Judge Loo’s alleged misconduct was not an isolated act of corruption but the **judicial confirmation of HPD’s street-level policy**. By the time the case entered his courtroom, the system had already established Mr. Lowndes as the target. Judge Loo’s actions were the final, formal application of this institutional vendetta.

His complicity was sophisticated and demonstrated a calculated intent to obstruct justice:

*   **Suborning Perjury via Insider Knowledge:** The alleged use of a non-verbal cue during an **audio-only hearing** was a calculated exploitation of a systemic vulnerability. As a former member of the Commission on Judicial Conduct, Judge Loo possessed intimate knowledge of how to manipulate proceedings while leaving no official trace. This was not a lapse in judgment; it was the work of an expert.
*   **Weaponizing the Oversight System:** The "resign-wait-return" maneuver is a profound abuse of process. By resigning, Judge Loo allegedly triggered the Commission's 90-day jurisdictional limit, effectively granting himself immunity. The fact that he was later listed as an active judge suggests this was a pre-planned escape hatch, rendering the entire judicial accountability system a sham.
*   **Formalizing the Narrative:** By allegedly suborning the dealer's false testimony and aggressively silencing Mr. Lowndes's objections, Judge Loo used the authority of the court to legally validate the false narrative HPD had been enforcing on the street. He rubber-stamped the vendetta, transforming it into a matter of official court record.

Judge Loo's actions align with federal statutes for **Suborning Perjury (18 U.S.C. § 1622)** and **Obstruction of Justice (18 U.S.C. § 1503)**.

### **3. The Nature of the Cover-Up: An Inverted System of Justice**

The events described are not evidence of "a few bad apples" but of a systemic rot where the core function of the justice system has been inverted.

1.  **Shared Motive:** The interlocking nature of the alleged crimes created a powerful, shared motive for a cover-up based on mutual self-preservation. Judge Loo, the HPD officers involved, and the dealer were all dependent on silencing the single source of their potential exposure: Paul Lowndes.
2.  **The Cover-Up in Action:** The cover-up was not a single event but a continuous campaign manifested through the actions themselves: the judicial manipulation, the law enforcement obstruction, the jurisdictional shell game, and the post-trial psychological operations.
3.  **Symbiotic Corruption:** The state-level corruption (HPD, Loo) and the specter of the dealer's "federal buddy" created a symbiotic system of impunity. HPD provided the street-level enforcement and plausible deniability. Judge Loo provided the judicial cover. And the alleged federal connection provided a chilling layer of intimidation that made all other parties stand down.

### **CONCLUSION: Consolidated Investigative Focus**

The evidence, when synthesized, points toward a premeditated conspiracy of retaliation originating within the Honolulu Police Department and extended through the judicial actions of Judge Wilson Loo. The LSD dealer was not the architect but the tool.

Therefore, the investigative focus must be elevated from the individual crimes of the dealer to the institutional conspiracy against Mr. Lowndes.

**Primary Recommended Lines of Inquiry:**
1.  **Investigate HPD for Conspiracy Against Rights (18 U.S.C. § 241):** Focus on the timeline of events before, during, and after Mr. Lowndes’s report to the FBI concerning the first corrupt officer. Subpoena HPD records related to all of Mr. Lowndes’s complaints to document the pattern of non-investigation.
2.  **Investigate Judge Wilson Loo for Obstruction of Justice and Suborning Perjury (18 U.S.C. § 1503, 1622):** Formally question the Hawaii Commission on Judicial Conduct and the State Judiciary about the discrepancy in Judge Loo’s employment status. This line of inquiry directly targets the alleged cover-up mechanism.
3.  **Treat the Asset as a Witness in a Larger Conspiracy:** The dealer should be approached not as the primary target, but as a witness and co-conspirator in a larger plot orchestrated by state actors. His knowledge of who he was "protected" by is critical.

This case represents a catastrophic failure of governance, where the institutions of justice were allegedly weaponized to persecute the citizen they were sworn to protect.
