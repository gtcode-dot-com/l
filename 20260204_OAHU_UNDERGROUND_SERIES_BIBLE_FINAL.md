# OAHU UNDERGROUND — SERIES BIBLE (FINAL)

## "Credibility Ramp with a Cold-Open Teaser"

**Sequence logic:** Lead with inarguable public records, build structural context, explain media silence, *then* present allegations — after the reader already understands the system that made them possible.

**Narrative engine:** Each issue delivers three things:

1. A cold-open scene (human, immediate, specific)
2. A documentable structure (filings, rosters, disclosures, rules)
3. A cliffhanger framed as a falsifiable question (what record would settle this?)

**Trust mantra (structural, not sloganeering):**

- What we can prove.
- What we can't prove from public records.
- What remains unanswered — and who could answer it.

## RECURRING SECTIONS (every issue)

**The Evidence Locker (2 pages)**
One document per issue, reproduced and annotated. Financial disclosure, board roster, commission rule, court filing. The reader holds the same paper you hold.

**The Network Map (center spread)**
Same base map every issue. One new node highlighted. By Issue 5, the reader has built the full picture themselves, one connection at a time.

**What We Can Verify / What We Cannot Verify (boxed sidebar)**
Two-column format. Consistency builds trust. Never overstate. Never understate.

**The Silence Index**
Who was contacted for this issue. What questions were asked. When. What deadline was given. What response — or non-response — was received. Right-of-reply as ritual, not gesture.

**Next Records to Pull**
Forward momentum. Tells the reader what's coming. Invites crowdsourcing. Creates accountability for the magazine itself.

## ISSUE 1 — THE MAP

**Cover line:** *"47 Board Seats, One Family"*

**Prologue teaser (1 page, before the issue begins):**

> December 2, 2022. A courtroom in Honolulu. An injunction hearing. The decisive alleged act is non-verbal. The court record is audio-only.
>
> We will return to this room in Issue 4. First, the map.

The teaser is a fragment — no allegation, no name, no claim. Just the premise and the recording vulnerability. It exists to give the reader narrative glue: something happened, and we're going to show you the architecture that surrounds it before we tell you what it was.

**Cold open:** 1956. A Cantonese immigrant family acquires the Damon Tract. The founding mythology of Hawaii National Bank — firecrackers, opening-day deposits, community pride. This is a success story. Start there honestly.

**Body:**

- Warren Luke's documented board positions: Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Hawaii branch director), American Red Cross (Hawaii chapter), Punahou School trustee, Pacific Forum board, plus 40+ others. Source: organizational rosters, annual reports, public bios. No interpretation needed — the list speaks.
- Wilson Loo's financial disclosures filed with the State Ethics Commission: holdings exceeding $2 million in Luke family interests (Hawaii National Bank, HNB subsidiaries, Luke-affiliated entities). Source: publicly filed financial disclosure statements.
- Janice Luke Loo's institutional roles: hospital boards, foundation positions, the bridge between the Luke philanthropic apparatus and the Loo judicial/legal career.
- The structural fact: both Wilson and Janice Loo served within the ecosystem of the Commission on Judicial Conduct — the body that polices judges in Hawaii.
- No allegations. Only documented connections, drawn from records the institutions themselves published.

**Evidence Locker:** Wilson Loo's financial disclosure form (annotated).

**Network Map:** Luke banking core + Loo judicial node. Two clusters, one marriage.

**Cliffhanger:** *When the person overseeing judicial conduct holds millions in financial interests connected to the family whose members sit on the boards of the state's most powerful institutions — what question should a journalist ask first? And who in Hawaii is positioned to ask it?*

---

## ISSUE 2 — THE BLIND SPOTS

**Cover line:** *"How a Court Can Be 'Transparent' and Still Be Unverifiable"*

**Cold open:** A reader walks into a Hawaii district court as a member of the public. What can they see? What can they record? What can they request afterward? Walk the reader through the experience — and through every point where the trail goes dark.

**Body:**

- The per diem judge model: attorneys who serve as judges part-time, then return to private practice. How it works, why Hawaii uses it, what structural conflicts it permits by design. Not an accusation — a mechanical description.
- The Commission on Judicial Conduct: confidential proceedings by statute. No public complaint reporting. Three-plus year lag in annual reports. A 90-day jurisdictional window (sourced to Commission rules) — if you don't file within 90 days, the Commission cannot act regardless of the merits.
- Audio-only court recording as standard practice. What audio captures. What it cannot capture. The gap between "on the record" and "observable."
- Wilson Loo's appellate record: the Lockey, Rego, and Noga cases. Published opinions, publicly available. What patterns emerge when you read them together. Let the reader draw conclusions.
- The structural thesis, stated cleanly: a system can be designed to be unaccountable without anyone designing it to be corrupt. The result is the same.

**Evidence Locker:** Commission on Judicial Conduct rules — the 90-day provision, annotated.

**Network Map:** Add the Commission node. Show where the Loo positions intersect the oversight body.

**Silence Index:** Formal inquiry sent to the Commission on Judicial Conduct. Questions asked. Deadline. Response or non-response documented.

**Cliffhanger:** *Institutional silence and institutional capture produce the same observable output: nothing. If the oversight system cannot be audited, then the only remaining check is journalism. So the next question is: what happens when journalism can't function either?*

## ISSUE 3 — THE ZONE OF POLITENESS

**Cover line:** *"Why the Story Didn't Die — It Was Never Born"*

**Cold open:** Early 2025. A dossier arrives at the offices of Honolulu Civil Beat — documented conflicts of interest, public filings, annotated disclosures. The initial response is interest. What follows is silence. Not rejection. Not "we looked into it and it doesn't hold up." Silence.

**Body:**

Three categories of structural constraint, documented without mind-reading:

**1. Boardroom Overlaps**
- Pierre Omidyar and Warren Luke: concurrent Punahou School trustees, 2007–2019. Twelve years of shared governance at Hawaii's most elite institution. Source: Punahou trustee rosters.
- Cathy Luke (state legislator, Warren's daughter) → Hawaii Leadership Forum → Omidyar 'Ohana Fund governance chain. Source: public organizational records.
- Luke Center → Kōkua Hawaii Foundation → North Shore conservation network. Shared institutional DNA.

**2. Personnel Bridges**
- Ryan Ozawa: former Hawaii National Bank ISO (information security officer), now Civil Beat contributor. Source: LinkedIn history, Civil Beat bylines.
- The pipeline from Luke-adjacent institutions into media roles — not conspiracy, topology.

**3. Donor Relationships**
- Luke family appears on Civil Beat's published donor list. Source: Civil Beat's own transparency page.
- Civil Beat maintains Wilson Loo's financial disclosures in its public database but has produced no investigation connecting those disclosures to the network documented in Issue 1.

**The structural point:** Civil Beat cannot investigate the Luke family for the same reason a fish cannot investigate water. This is not an accusation of editorial suppression. It is a description of the social physics of a small state where institutional, philanthropic, and media power share board tables, donors, and school ties. The result: certain stories are structurally unaskable.

**Evidence Locker:** Civil Beat donor list excerpt showing Luke family (annotated).

**Network Map:** Add the media node. Omidyar/Punahou overlap. Ozawa bridge. Donor link. The map now connects banking → judiciary → oversight → media.

**Silence Index:** Civil Beat contacted. Questions asked. Timeline of initial engagement and subsequent non-response documented.

**Cliffhanger:** *When institutional oversight can't examine itself, and journalism is socially sandboxed from asking, what remains? Only the record itself — if it exists. In Issue 4, we return to that courtroom. December 2, 2022. The audio is running. The camera is not.*

---

## ISSUE 4 — DECEMBER SECOND

**Cover line:** *"What Audio Can't Capture"*

**Cold open:** Return to the prologue fragment. Now the reader has the full structural context: they know the network (Issue 1), the oversight gaps (Issue 2), and why no one reported it (Issue 3). The courtroom scene is no longer a wild claim. It's the predictable output of a system the reader already understands.

**Body:**

- December 2, 2022. An injunction hearing. The specific proceeding, the parties, the stakes — told cleanly, with dates and settings fixed.
- The alleged incident: a non-verbal head gesture during cross-examination on a specific topic. Described precisely, with explicit acknowledgment that this is firsthand testimony — unverifiable by audio record by definition.
- The audio-only recording gap: why this specific type of alleged act is structurally unprovable under Hawaii's court recording standard. Not an excuse — a mechanical fact established in Issue 2.
- Aggressive interruption preventing real-time documentation. What the audio does and does not capture of this sequence.
- Case sealing. What became inaccessible and when.
- The complaint filed with the Commission on Judicial Conduct. The response: "no jurisdiction." The 90-day loophole — established in Issue 2 as structural, now shown in application.
- The website discrepancy: Wilson Loo listed as active on judiciary website after alleged resignation. Dates documented. Screenshots preserved.
- The Audrey Stanley connection: public defender who had knowledge of a specific threat, relayed a coercive offer, and now serves as a per diem judge. Each element sourced to the extent possible — what is documented, what is firsthand testimony, clearly delineated.

**Evidence Locker:** Commission on Judicial Conduct response letter — the "no jurisdiction" finding (annotated).

**Network Map:** Add the courtroom node. Stanley connection. The map is nearly complete.

**Verify / Cannot Verify box (critical for this issue):**

| What We Can Verify | What Rests on Firsthand Testimony |
|---|---|
| Date and type of hearing | The alleged non-verbal gesture |
| Audio-only recording standard | Specific words during interruption |
| Case sealing | Stanley's private communication |
| Commission complaint filed | The coercive offer |
| Commission "no jurisdiction" response | |
| Website discrepancy (screenshots) | |
| Stanley's current per diem status | |

**Silence Index:** Formal inquiries sent to Wilson Loo, Audrey Stanley, the Commission, and the judiciary's administrative office. Questions. Deadlines. Responses or non-responses.

**Cliffhanger:** *Every official channel has been used. Every institutional door has returned silence or "no jurisdiction." What remains is the evidence itself — what can be documented, what cannot, and what a reader can verify independently. Issue 5 opens the full file.*

---

## ISSUE 5 — THE RECORD

**Cover line:** *"Here Is Everything. Verify It Yourself."*

**Cold open:** Not a scene. A statement of method. This issue is the evidence file — organized, transparent, and annotated so that any reader, journalist, attorney, or investigator can assess it independently.

**Body:**

**The Claims Ledger**

Two-column verification framework applied to the full series:

*Column A — Public Record (independently verifiable):*
- Financial disclosures (Issue 1)
- Board rosters and organizational records (Issue 1)
- Commission on Judicial Conduct rules and response letters (Issue 2)
- Appellate opinions (Issue 2)
- Civil Beat donor lists and personnel history (Issue 3)
- Commission correspondence and "no jurisdiction" finding (Issue 4)
- Website discrepancy documentation (Issue 4)
- ODC referral filed (documented)

*Column B — Firsthand Testimony (author's account):*
- The courtroom gesture (Issue 4)
- The Hartmann threat
- The Stanley offer
- The alleged blackmail

**The epistemic problem, stated directly:** Demanding official corroboration for institutional capture allegations asks the accused institution to certify the accusation against itself. This is not a rhetorical dodge — it is the structural reality established across Issues 1–4. The system that would need to validate the claim is the system the claim is about.

**Actions taken:**
- FBI complaint filed July 2025
- ODC complaint filed against Audrey Stanley
- UIPA requests filed (enumerated)
- This publication

**Methodological transparency:** How the series was built. What editorial standards were applied. Where uncertainty was marked. Why allegations were sequenced after structural documentation. This section exists because the method *is* the credibility.

**The cost-of-silence vignette (1 paragraph, human):**
One tight passage — not rhetorical, not self-pitying — about what it means in practice to have exhausted every institutional channel and to be sitting with a laptop on the North Shore, publishing a magazine because no one else will carry the story. Not "feel sorry for me." More: "This is what the tail end of the accountability chain looks like when every other link has failed."

**Evidence Locker:** FBI complaint receipt or UIPA request (annotated).

**Network Map (final, complete):** All nodes connected. The full architecture. Banking → philanthropy → schools → oversight → judiciary → media → back to banking. The reader built this map one node at a time across five issues. Now they see it whole.

**Closing:**

No "therefore guilt." No verdict. Instead:

*Here is the smallest set of records and responses that would clarify the entire controversy. Here is who holds them. Here is what we have asked for. Here is what has been answered.*

*The documents are public. The network is mapped. The structural conflicts are on the record. What happens next is not up to one person with a laptop.*

*It's up to whoever reads this and decides to pull the next thread.*

## OPTIONAL ISSUE 6 — THE REFORM ISSUE

**Cover line:** *"What Would Fix This"*

If the series extends to six, this issue de-escalates from accusation energy into civic design:

- Mandatory audio/video recording in certain proceedings
- Recusal and financial disclosure modernization
- Oversight jurisdiction reform (the 90-day window)
- Public complaint reporting standards for the Commission
- A practical "How to Request Records" kit — UIPA templates, contact information, filing instructions

This is the issue that helps readers *do something*. It also reframes the entire series: not a grudge, but a governance critique with proposed solutions.

---

## PLAUSIBILITY RULES (non-negotiable)

1. **Separate structure from accusation.** "This overlap exists" ≠ "therefore corruption." Let readers walk the bridge themselves.
2. **Use "alleged / reported / according to" relentlessly where required.** Structural credibility, not stylistic hedging.
3. **Right-of-reply as ritual.** Every issue: who was contacted, what was asked, deadline given, response or non-response. Published in the Silence Index.
4. **Minimize naming private individuals unless essential.** Public figures and public roles only, unless identification is unavoidable.
5. **Treat your own testimony like sworn testimony.** Dates, settings, exact words where confident. Mark uncertainty explicitly.
6. **Never tell the reader what to conclude.** Build the map. Let the territory explain itself.

---

## THE READER'S JOURNEY

After Issue 1, the reader thinks: *"That's a real power structure."*
After Issue 2, the reader thinks: *"So accountability might be structurally impossible."*
After Issue 3, the reader thinks: *"Even journalism is socially sandboxed."*
After Issue 4, the reader thinks: *"Of course that happened. The system was built for it."*
After Issue 5, the reader thinks: *"I can verify this myself."*

That progression — from documented network to structural analysis to media critique to specific allegation to open evidence file — is what converts a personal story into a public record that survives the author.
