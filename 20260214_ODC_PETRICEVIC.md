## I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT (NARROW, RECORD-BASED REQUEST)

This complaint concerns the conduct of Bosko Petricevic, Esq., counsel for Jason Dean McKinley, during a sealed First Circuit hearing on December 2, 2022. I appeared pro se. The hearing was recorded on audio only and then sealed.

This submission is intentionally narrow. It asks ODC to obtain the sealed audio and court file and to evaluate counsel's conduct against that record, under three specific Hawaiʻi Rules of Professional Conduct:

1. **HRPC Rule 8.3(b)** — whether counsel witnessed judicial conduct raising a substantial question as to the presiding judge's fitness for office and failed to report it.
2. **HRPC Rule 3.3(a)(4) and (b)** — whether counsel permitted materially contested testimony to stand without remedial measures, despite a filed exhibit materially inconsistent with that testimony.
3. **HRPC Rule 8.4(f)** — whether counsel's request to seal the record, in context, knowingly assisted conduct that violated applicable judicial rules or other law.

I do not ask ODC to adopt my characterization of the underlying dispute. I ask ODC to review the sealed record, determine what occurred, and evaluate counsel's obligations in light of that record.

## II. FACTUAL STATEMENT (CHRONOLOGICAL, RECORD-ANCHORABLE)

### A. Context and Procedural Posture

Between approximately 2020 and 2022, Jason Dean McKinley engaged in a course of conduct toward me that included physical assault, stalking, harassment, and furnishing of LSD at Stonefish Grill in Haleʻiwa (a commercial establishment with known CCTV coverage). I reported these matters to HPD and contacted HPD Narcotics/Vice and the DEA regarding the controlled substance furnishing. HPD declined to investigate; the DEA acknowledged the report but assessed the single-incident furnishing as below its operational threshold.

Having exhausted ordinary law enforcement channels, I sought a civil injunction against harassment. The petition was heard on December 2, 2022 before Judge Wilson M.N. Loo. Mr. Petricevic appeared for Mr. McKinley. I appeared pro se. The proceeding was audio-only.

### B. The December 2, 2022 Hearing: Core Sequence

The sequence below reflects what I personally observed. Each element should be verifiable from the sealed audio and court file:

1. **Sworn testimony commenced.** Mr. McKinley was placed under oath.
2. **Controlled-substance question.** I asked Mr. McKinley whether he had furnished LSD to me.
3. **Material exhibit already in the file.** A text-message exhibit in the court file included my message to Mr. McKinley stating: "I took the acid." I sent that message. The exhibit is materially inconsistent with a categorical denial of any LSD transaction between us. I do not ask ODC to decide the ultimate meaning of the message; I ask ODC to evaluate whether the inconsistency was material and whether counsel's obligations were triggered.
4. **Visible judicial signal.** Immediately before Mr. McKinley answered, I observed Judge Loo direct a visible "no" head gesture toward the witness. Mr. Petricevic was seated facing the bench and was in a position to observe the same gesture.
5. **Witness denial.** Mr. McKinley denied furnishing LSD.
6. **Suppression of objection.** I attempted to place the judge's signal on the record by stating: "Let the record show that the judge just—" Judge Loo interrupted me and prevented completion of the objection. The audio should reflect the interruption and my truncated statement.
7. **Out-of-turn defamatory allegation.** Before sealing, Mr. McKinley made an out-of-turn statement accusing me of child sexual abuse. The allegation was false. Judge Loo did not strike it, did not admonish the witness, and did not permit me to respond.
8. **Sealing request.** Mr. Petricevic then requested that the record be sealed. The court granted the request.

### C. Consequence of Sealing

Sealing placed an unrebutted allegation of child sexual abuse inside an official record accessible to authorized institutional actors, while foreclosing my ability to rebut or correct the record through ordinary means. The practical effect is that the allegation can be relied upon inside institutional channels while I am prevented from answering it in the public record.

That consequence is directly relevant to whether the sealing request, in context, knowingly assisted judicial misconduct or other unlawful conduct.

## III. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT RULES IMPLICATED

### A. HRPC Rule 8.3(b): Duty to Report Judicial Misconduct

Rule 8.3(b) requires a lawyer who knows that a judge has committed a violation of applicable rules of judicial conduct that raises a substantial question as to the judge's fitness for office to inform the appropriate authority.

Two events independently raise such a question if corroborated by the record:

- **Apparent judicial signaling of testimony.** A presiding judge who directs a witness's answer by visible gesture during sworn examination compromises the integrity of the adjudication.
- **Suppression of an objection directed at the judge's own conduct.** Preventing a litigant from placing such an objection on the record denies a basic procedural safeguard.

Mr. Petricevic was present, facing the bench, and positioned to observe the signal and the interruption. To my knowledge, he has not reported either event to the Commission on Judicial Conduct or any other appropriate authority.

### B. HRPC Rule 3.3(a)(4) and (b): Candor Toward the Tribunal

Rule 3.3(a)(4) prohibits a lawyer from offering evidence known to be false and requires reasonable remedial measures if the lawyer later learns material evidence is false. Rule 3.3(b) extends these duties through the conclusion of the proceeding.

The sworn denial of furnishing LSD was materially inconsistent with a filed text-message exhibit. Reasonable minds may differ on the exhibit's ultimate import, but the inconsistency is material. ODC is positioned to assess whether counsel had knowledge (actual or inferable from context) that triggered remedial obligations and, if so, whether any remedial measures were taken.

### C. HRPC Rule 8.4(f): Knowing Assistance in Judicial Misconduct

Rule 8.4(f) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to knowingly assist a judge in conduct that violates applicable rules of judicial conduct or other law.

The sequence here is salient: apparent judicial signaling, denial aligned with the signal, suppression of the objection, an unrebutted defamatory allegation, and then a request to seal. If counsel witnessed conduct raising a substantial question about judicial integrity and nonetheless requested sealing without objection, motion to strike, or report, ODC should evaluate whether that request knowingly assisted the concealment or entrenchment of misconduct.

I do not claim that counsel conceived or directed any judicial conduct. I ask whether, if the record corroborates the sequence, the sealing request in context constitutes knowing assistance under Rule 8.4(f).

## IV. STRUCTURAL CONTEXT (LIMITED, FACTUAL)

ODC may find the following structural fact relevant to its evaluation.

Audrey L.E. Stanley, my public defender in an earlier First Circuit criminal matter (c. 2015–2017), was the first person to whom I reported a credible in-person murder threat connected to the same North Shore network from which the McKinley matter later arose. Ms. Stanley characterized the threat as "no big deal" and, to my knowledge, did not report it to law enforcement. She later relayed an offer that charges would be dropped if I left Hawaiʻi. A separate ODC complaint concerning Ms. Stanley's conduct is being filed contemporaneously.

Ms. Stanley has since been appointed as a per diem judge in the First Circuit, **replacing Judge Wilson M.N. Loo on the same bench**.

I do not offer this to prove a conspiracy. I offer it because it illustrates a structural dynamic in which the same complainant encountered successive officials on the same bench whose conduct now requires formal review. The predicate facts—Judge Loo's departure from per diem service, Ms. Stanley's appointment, and the timing—are matters of public record.

## V. EVIDENCE ODC CAN OBTAIN

The central evidence is in the sealed record. ODC has authority to obtain it. I respectfully identify the following materials:

1. **Sealed audio recording** of the December 2, 2022 hearing, in full.
2. **Sealed court file**, including all exhibits, especially the text-message exhibit containing "I took the acid" and any foundation testimony.
3. **Sealing motion or oral request**, the court's oral ruling, and the written sealing order.
4. **Minute entries and clerk notations** for the December 2, 2022 hearing, including any notations reflecting the out-of-turn statement.
5. **Docket sheet** reflecting the procedural history through sealing.

### Materials I Can Provide Upon Request

- Approximate audio time-stamps for the question, judicial gesture, suppressed objection, defamatory statement, and sealing request.
- HPD report numbers and incident documentation relating to Mr. McKinley.
- Correspondence with the Commission on Judicial Conduct, including the June 26, 2025 letter from Vice Chair Doris M. Ching declining jurisdiction over Judge Loo.
- Contemporaneous ODC complaint packet (Kanemoto, Stanley, Landsberg) for background and structural context.

## VI. REQUESTED ACTION

I respectfully request that ODC:

1. **Obtain and review the sealed audio recording and court file** from the December 2, 2022 hearing.
2. **Evaluate compliance with HRPC Rule 8.3(b)** by determining whether counsel observed (or was positioned to observe) the judicial conduct described above and whether he reported it to the appropriate authority.
3. **Evaluate compliance with HRPC Rule 3.3(a)(4) and (b)** by determining whether the inconsistency between the sworn denial and the filed exhibit was material and whether counsel took remedial measures.
4. **Evaluate whether the sealing request implicates HRPC Rule 8.4(f)** in light of the full sequence of events that preceded it.
5. **Preserve the sealed record** pending any related inquiries. I have filed a superseding complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice, Public Integrity Section (parallel notice to the FBI Honolulu Field Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Hawaiʻi) requesting federal review of the same sealed record for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1622, 1503, and 242.

## VII. DECLARATION

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States and the State of Hawaiʻi that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
