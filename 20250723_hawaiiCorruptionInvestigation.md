# Breaking: Hawaii Judge Quietly Returns to Bench After Misconduct Allegations
## New Evidence Reveals Wilson Loo Still Listed as Active Judge Despite Commission Claims

Six weeks after Hawaii's Commission on Judicial Conduct claimed Judge Wilson Loo had "resigned" to avoid accountability for alleged courtroom misconduct, new evidence reveals a disturbing pattern of institutional deception and coordinated obstruction that extends far beyond a single corrupt judge.

Public records and witness testimony now paint a picture of systematic criminal activity involving judicial misconduct, police obstruction, prosecutorial manipulation, and what appears to be organized retaliation against a federal whistleblower—all while Hawaii's oversight institutions engage in elaborate shell games to protect the accused.

## The Jurisdictional Deception Unravels

On March 13, 2025, the Commission on Judicial Conduct informed this reporter that Wilson Loo was "no longer a per diem judge as of July 2024" and claimed they had "no jurisdiction" to investigate his alleged suborning of perjury because more than 90 days had passed since his departure.

But Hawaii State Judiciary records tell a different story. Until June 20, 2025—nearly a year after his supposed "resignation"—Wilson M.N. Loo remained listed as an active First Circuit Per Diem Judge on the official state website. Only after this reporter's media complaints and public pressure did his name finally disappear from the roster.

**The timeline reveals a calculated deception:**
- **July 2024:** Commission claims Loo "resigned" 
- **March 2025:** Commission uses supposed resignation to claim no jurisdiction
- **May 2025:** State website still lists Loo as active judge
- **June 20, 2025:** Name removed only after media complaints exposed the contradiction
- **June 26, 2025:** Commission finally acknowledges the contradiction

This isn't administrative oversight—it's systematic institutional fraud designed to shield a corrupt judge from accountability until public pressure forced their hand.

## The Federal Criminal Complaint: Escalation to Public Record

On July 12, 2025, this reporter filed a comprehensive federal criminal complaint with the FBI, formally documenting what appears to be a RICO enterprise involving multiple Hawaii officials. The public filing of this complaint represents the complete breakdown of state-level accountability mechanisms.

The federal complaint details systematic criminal activity including:
- **Judge Wilson Loo:** Suborning perjury using insider knowledge from his Commission on Judicial Conduct service
- **REDACTED (Defendant):** Perjury regarding drug distribution while claiming "federal buddy" connections
- **HPD Officers:** Systematic refusal to investigate documented felonies
- **Young Kwak:** Grand theft and perjury to federal grand jury
- **Vincent Kanemoto:** Alleged jury intimidation tactics

## The Loo Network: A Web of Corruption

New evidence suggests Wilson Loo's alleged courtroom misconduct was not isolated judicial bias, but part of a broader criminal network that includes:

**Vincent Kanemoto (Prosecuting Attorney):** Witnesses report Kanemoto formed a mock pistol with his hands, pointed it at 12 jurors, and declared: "There was no gun. But what if there was? Convict him." This alleged jury intimidation represents prosecutorial misconduct of the highest order.

**Young Kwak (Attorney):** Sources describe systematic "state-sanctioned grand theft" and perjury to a grand jury, coordinated with James Yuen, who now holds positions within HPD—creating a direct pipeline between prosecutorial corruption and police obstruction.

**Audrey Stanley (Per Diem Judge):** During her tenure as Public Defender, Stanley allegedly forwarded an extortionate offer to "drop charges if [client] left the state" after being informed of a murder threat conspiracy involving Eugene and Rita Hartmann. Stanley's role appears to have been as a messenger rather than the originator of the extortion.

**The Jack Johnson Connection:** Multiple sources confirm that associates of celebrity musician Jack Johnson engaged in witness tampering regarding the Eugene/Rita Hartmann murder threat, with police officers later telling victims that "Jack Johnson's circle is allowed to issue murder threats."

## The Federal Nexus: Retaliation Against a Whistleblower

What transforms this from local corruption into a federal case is the systematic targeting of someone who had previously contacted federal authorities about serious crimes. The victim in the Wilson Loo case had earlier reported to the FBI:

- A conspired murder threat by Eugene and Rita Hartmann
- Witness tampering and blackmail by a Jack Johnson associate outside Kahala Whole Foods
- The targeting escalated dramatically after these federal contacts

The pattern suggests organized retaliation against a federal whistleblower, involving:
- **Intelligence Asset Deployment:** Post-trial contact from individuals with federal security backgrounds
- **Social Media Manipulation:** Coordinated X (Twitter) harassment campaigns
- **Local Harassment Networks:** Former State Department intern "Matthew" systematically disrupting the victim's community relationships

## Police Obstruction: The HPD Connection

Honolulu Police Department's response to multiple crime reports reveals systematic obstruction:

**Officers Brandt and Shatoo** allegedly used color of law to cover up ongoing violence and harassment, with Officer Brandt specifically leveraging defamation as justification for refusing to investigate documented crimes.

When the victim reported felony perjury via 911, the responding female officer declared it was "not HPD's job" to investigate perjury—a fundamental abdication of law enforcement duty that suggests coordinated instructions to protect the criminal network.

**Most damning:** One officer explicitly told the victim that Jack Johnson's associates were "allowed" to issue murder threats, revealing institutional knowledge of protected criminal activity.

## The Current Escalation: Public Disclosure as Last Resort

Facing complete institutional abandonment, the victim has now taken to social media, directly naming participants in what he characterizes as a RICO conspiracy:

Recent tweets tag the FBI directly, naming specific judges, prosecutors, and police officers while detailing their alleged crimes. The complete silence from accused parties—who would normally file immediate defamation suits against false accusers—speaks volumes about the credibility of these allegations.

**The institutional non-response is particularly telling:**
- No defamation suits despite devastating public accusations
- No police action for "false reporting" despite specific criminal allegations
- No judicial response to public accusations of felony misconduct
- No federal intervention despite clear federal crimes alleged

## The Technology Connection: Corporate Complicity

The harassment campaign included sophisticated technological targeting:
- Google harassment related to the victim's investigation into the Hartmann murder threat
- Coordinated X (Twitter) targeting in December 2022
- Strategic deployment of social media to isolate and discredit the victim

These corporate platforms allegedly became weapons in the retaliation campaign, raising questions about tech company complicity in targeting federal whistleblowers.

## The Bigger Picture: Organized Criminal Enterprise

This case now appears to involve a systematic criminal enterprise operating under color of law, including:

**Racketeering Elements:**
- Pattern of judicial misconduct (Loo, Stanley)
- Prosecutorial corruption (Kanemoto, Kwak)
- Police obstruction (HPD officers)
- Witness tampering (Jack Johnson associates)
- Retaliation against federal witnesses

**Federal Crimes:**
- 18 USC 1622 (Suborning Perjury)
- 18 USC 1503 (Obstruction of Justice)
- 18 USC 242 (Civil Rights Violations)
- 18 USC 1512 (Witness Tampering)
- 18 USC 1513 (Retaliation Against Witnesses)
- RICO violations (18 USC 1961-1968)

## The Institutional Breakdown

What emerges is a complete breakdown of Hawaii's justice system:
- **Judicial misconduct** protected by oversight evasion until media pressure forced action
- **Prosecutorial corruption** coordinated with police obstruction
- **Law enforcement** serving criminal networks over public safety
- **Celebrity connections** providing cover for serious crimes
- **Federal non-response** enabling systematic targeting

## The Call for Federal Intervention

This case demands immediate federal action. When state and local institutions systematically coordinate to protect criminal networks while targeting federal whistleblowers, federal intervention becomes not just appropriate but essential.

The evidence suggests:
- Organized criminal activity under RICO
- Civil rights violations requiring federal prosecution
- Systematic retaliation against federal witnesses
- Interstate coordination of harassment and intimidation

## Conclusion: Justice Perverted

The Wilson Loo case has evolved from allegations of judicial misconduct into evidence of systematic criminal enterprise involving multiple levels of Hawaii's government. The institutional response—characterized by evasion, obstruction, and coordinated silence until forced by media pressure—validates rather than refutes these serious allegations.

When judges can manipulate proceedings, prosecutors can intimidate juries, police can refuse to investigate crimes, and oversight bodies can engineer jurisdictional shell games, the very concept of justice becomes meaningless.

The victim in this case now faces financial ruin, social isolation, and ongoing harassment—the predictable outcome when criminal networks operate with institutional protection. His public documentation and federal criminal complaint represent a last resort when all legitimate channels have been corrupted or captured.

Federal authorities now hold the key to determining whether Hawaii operates under the rule of law or under the rule of connected criminals. The evidence demands investigation. The public deserves answers. Justice demands accountability.
