**RE: Request for Federal Investigation - Judicial Corruption, Suborning Perjury, Obstruction of Justice, and RICO Violations**

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I am reporting a pattern of criminal conduct by Hawaii state judges, law enforcement officials, and private parties that constitutes federal crimes including suborning perjury (18 USC §1622), obstruction of justice (18 USC §1503), deprivation of rights under color of law (18 USC §242), and potential RICO violations (18 USC §1961-1968). This complaint involves:

1. **Judge Wilson M.N. Loo** - Suborned perjury during court proceedings and exploited his insider knowledge from serving on the Hawaii Commission on Judicial Conduct to evade accountability
2. **[Defendant's Name]** - Committed perjury regarding drug distribution and claimed to have a "federal buddy"
3. **Judge Audrey L.E. Stanley** - Failed to act on murder threat reports and allegedly forwarded extortion offer
4. **Multiple HPD Officers** - Systematically refused to investigate reported felonies
5. **Young Kwak** - Grand theft and false testimony to grand jury
6. **James Yuen** - Coordinated perjurious testimony
7. **Eugene & Rita Hartmann** - Issued murder threats with possible intelligence connections

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION

This matter falls under federal jurisdiction due to:
- Violations of federal criminal statutes (18 USC §§1621, 1622, 1503, 1512, 242)
- Interstate commerce implications
- Civil rights violations
- False statements to federal grand jury
- Potential involvement of federal assets/informants
- Pattern of racketeering activity crossing state lines

## DETAILED ALLEGATIONS

### 1. JUDGE WILSON LOO - SUBORNING PERJURY (18 USC §1622)

On December 2, 2022, during an injunction hearing that was deliberately recorded as audio-only despite being conducted in person, Judge Wilson Loo committed the federal felony of suborning perjury:

- **The Crime:** When [Defendant] was asked under oath about providing LSD to me, Judge Loo made a deliberate "no" head gesture with accompanying facial expression, visible to the witness but not captured on audio recording
- **The Cover-up:** When I attempted to state for the record "Let the record show that the judge just...", Judge Loo aggressively interrupted, shouting "Nah ah ah enough out of you!!" preventing documentation of his visual cue
- **The Evidence:** Text messages submitted by the defendant himself proved he had provided LSD (stating I "took the acid"), directly contradicting his perjured testimony
- **The Insider Knowledge:** Judge Loo previously served on the Hawaii Commission on Judicial Conduct, giving him intimate knowledge of how to exploit audio-only recordings to avoid detection

### 2. THE CORRUPTION LOOPHOLE - OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

After reporting Judge Loo's felony conduct:
- July 2024: Judge Loo "resigned" from his per diem position
- March 2025: Commission on Judicial Conduct claimed "no jurisdiction" due to 90-day rule
- June 2025: Hawaii State Judiciary website still lists Wilson M.N. Loo as active judge
- July 2025: Loo delisted

### 3. [DEFENDANT'S NAME] - PERJURY AND FEDERAL CONNECTIONS

- Committed perjury by denying drug distribution despite his own text evidence
- Days before hearing, stated on phone: "I have another buddy who is federal" (suggesting existing law enforcement connections)
- This conversation likely captured by federal surveillance given my prior FBI contact
- Pattern of escalating harassment including vehicular assault after learning of my federal whistleblowing

### 4. HPD SYSTEMATIC OBSTRUCTION

Multiple HPD officers refused to investigate documented crimes:
- Female 911 operator: Refused to take perjury report, claimed it was "my responsibility to prove it"
- Refused to investigate LSD distribution despite specific location of video evidence
- Pattern suggests coordination based on my prior federal whistleblowing about police corruption

### 5. THE LARGER CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE

This is not isolated misconduct but a coordinated criminal enterprise involving:
- **Young Kwak**: Committed grand theft and provided false testimony to grand jury
- **James Yuen**: Coordinated Kwak's perjurious testimony
- **Vincent Kanemoto**: Made extortionate offers through attorney Audrey Stanley
- **Judge Audrey Stanley**: Dismissed murder threats from Eugene & Rita Hartmann, attempted to relay extortion to force me to leave state
- **Eugene & Rita Hartmann**: Issued coordinated murder threats with possible intelligence connections

### 6. PATTERN OF RETALIATION

Following my federal whistleblowing:
- Officer removed from Wahiawa beat after my FBI contact
- Systematic harassment by multiple parties with government connections
- Post-trial defamation campaign in community
- Professional targeting by individuals with security clearances

## EVIDENCE AVAILABLE

1. Audio recording of court proceeding showing interruption when documenting Judge Loo's conduct
2. Text messages proving defendant's perjury about drug distribution
3. HPD report numbers documenting refused investigations
4. Commission on Judicial Conduct letters showing resignation timeline
5. Current judiciary website screenshots showing Judge Loo still listed as active
6. Documentation of all connected criminal acts forming pattern of racketeering

## SPECIFIC FEDERAL CRIMES REQUIRING INVESTIGATION

- **18 USC §1622** - Suborning Perjury (Judge Loo)
- **18 USC §1621** - Perjury (Defendant, Young Kwak)
- **18 USC §1503** - Obstruction of Justice (Judge Loo, HPD)
- **18 USC §1512** - Witness Tampering (post-trial retaliation)
- **18 USC §242** - Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law
- **18 USC §1001** - False Statements (to grand jury)
- **18 USC §1961-1968** - RICO (pattern of racketeering activity)

## REQUEST FOR ACTION

I respectfully request the FBI:

1. Open immediate investigation into Judge Wilson Loo for suborning perjury
2. Investigate the systemic "resignation loophole" enabling judicial criminals to evade accountability
3. Review NSA/federal surveillance for defendant's "federal buddy" conversation
4. Investigate coordinated HPD refusal to investigate reported felonies
5. Examine the broader criminal enterprise connecting these state actors
6. Pursue RICO charges for the pattern of racketeering activity

## CONCLUSION

This represents a clear and present danger to the integrity of Hawaii's justice system. When judges can commit felonies using insider knowledge, resign temporarily to avoid prosecution, and return to the bench - while police systematically refuse to investigate - the rule of law collapses.

The federal government must intervene where state systems have been corrupted beyond self-correction. I am available to provide all documentation and testimony necessary to support this investigation.

I swear under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Respectfully submitted,

Paul E Lowndes
