### The Aloha Protection Racket
**An Investigative Report on Judge Wilson Loo and the Criminal Enterprise Shielding (redacted)**

By Ekewaka Lono • Published: August 26, 2025

**Legal Notice:** *This report contains allegations of serious criminal misconduct based on documented events and firsthand testimony. All individuals are presumed innocent. This publication follows the complete failure of official channels to address a clear and present danger to the rule of law in Hawaii.*

### The Architect

His name is **[Judge Wilson M.N. Loo](https://trellis.law/judge/wilson.m.n.loo)**. He was a **[sitting judge in Hawaii's First Circuit Court](https://lawyers.justia.com/lawyer/wilson-m-n-loo-692739)**, a man entrusted with the absolute and final authority of the state. He is also the architect of a criminal conspiracy to protect a violent, drug-dealing trust funder named **(redacted)**, a conspiracy that reached its apex when **[Judge Loo](https://www.lawyers.com/honolulu/hawaii/wilson-m-n-loo-893448-a/)**, from his elevated bench, allegedly committed a federal felony to silence a victim and bury a crime.

This is not a story of a system that failed. This is the story of a system that worked exactly as its new owners intended. It is the story of a protection racket, run from a courthouse, with a judge acting as its enforcer. And I was the man he tried to silence.

### The Protected Asset

(redacted) is not merely a defendant—he is a protected asset within this criminal enterprise. He is a wealthy trust-funder with a self-professed "federal buddy" and a documented history of reckless behavior.

Before he ever set foot in Judge Loo's courtroom, (redacted) had engaged in a months-long campaign of escalating terror against me, his neighbor. This campaign included:

- **Physical Assault:** Documented in HPD reports.
- **Distribution of Controlled Substances:** Admitted via his own text message evidence, which included the distribution of both cocaine and LSD.
- **Attempted Vehicular Manslaughter:** A high-speed assault on a country road, reported to HPD and systematically ignored.
- **Stalking & Harassment:** A constant barrage of intimidation, often with a cruel, personal focus on my deceased parents.

When I refused to be silenced, (redacted) and his network did not face justice. Instead, they activated their most powerful asset: Judge Wilson Loo.

### The Crime

The injunction hearing on **December 2, 2022,** was the climax. It was a masterclass in calculated, criminal misconduct, executed by a judge with intimate, insider knowledge of the system's own weaknesses.

The courtroom was, by design, recorded **audio-only**. This was not an accident; it was the foundation of the crime.

I was cross-examining (redacted) under oath. I asked him a simple, direct question: "Did you provide me with LSD?"

Before (redacted) could answer, I watched Judge Wilson Loo, from his bench, perform a deliberate, non-verbal act. He made a clear, unmistakable "no" head gesture, accompanied by a facial expression that silently commanded the witness to lie.

Following his judge's silent order, (redacted) committed perjury, denying he had ever provided the drug.

I immediately attempted to object. My words were, "Let the record show that the judge just…"

I was not allowed to finish. Judge Loo, his voice booming with authority, cut me off, shouting **"Nah ah ah enough out of you!!"** In that single, aggressive interruption, he accomplished three things: he silenced a victim, he protected a perjurer, and he erased his own felony from the official audio record.

He then sealed the case. He buried his crime under the full authority of the state.

### The System

A crime this audacious cannot be committed by one man alone. It requires a system—a network of complicit actors who create the environment of impunity necessary for it to occur. This system, this Aloha Protection Racket, worked in perfect, symbiotic harmony.

- **The Police (The Muscle):** Before the trial, the **Honolulu Police Department** had already done its part. Multiple officers, including **Officer Brandt** and **Officer Shatoo**, systematically refused to investigate my documented reports against (redacted). They ran interference, provided false information about the service of a restraining order, and in one instance, Officer Brandt stood as top cover while (redacted) harassed me about my dead parents. HPD did not fail to do its job; it performed its real job perfectly, which was to protect the asset and break down the victim before he ever reached the courthouse.

- **The Judiciary (The Fixer):** Judge Loo performed his role as the ultimate fixer. He understood the system's flaws because he was once a part of the body that policed it, the **Hawaii Commission on Judicial Conduct.** This insider knowledge allowed him to architect a perfect, deniable crime. When I reported his felony, the system proved its loyalty. The Commission allowed Loo to "resign" temporarily, using a 90-day jurisdictional loophole to evade investigation, only for him to quietly reappear on the list of active judges. The oversight body was an accomplice.

- **The Network (The Beneficiaries):** This protection was not for one man. It was for a network. (redacted)'s impunity is the same impunity enjoyed by figures like **Eugene and Rita Hartmann,** associates of the celebrity "Johnson circle" who had previously subjected me to a credible, uninvestigated murder threat. The pattern is clear: a protected class exists in Hawaii that can threaten, stalk, and lie under oath, confident that the police will look the other way and the judges will ensure they are shielded.

### The Verdict

This is not a conspiracy theory. This is a **RICO enterprise.** It is a functioning, multi-layered criminal organization with a clear and consistent purpose: to use the instruments of the state—the badge, the robe, the official record—to protect its members while persecuting its enemies.

The evidence exists. The audio recording of Judge Loo's interruption. The text messages proving (redacted)'s perjury. The police reports documenting HPD's inaction. Each is a thread. When woven together, they reveal the entire tapestry of a system that has been completely and criminally captured.

This is my report. I was not a participant in a legal dispute. I was a witness to, and the victim of, a crime. A crime orchestrated from a judge's bench, enabled by the police, and now, exposed to the world.

The federal government now has a choice. It can continue to allow this documented criminal enterprise to fester, thereby becoming a silent partner to its crimes. Or it can uphold its constitutional duty to intervene when a state's own system of justice has become the primary tool of injustice.

The record is now public. The architect has been named. The choice is yours.
