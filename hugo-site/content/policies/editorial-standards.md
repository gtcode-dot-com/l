# Editorial Standards

Oahu Underground reporting follows an evidence-first process.

## Core Practices

1. Primary-source documentation comes before narrative claims whenever possible.
2. Claims are labeled by evidence class (public records, direct testimony, analysis, or inference).
3. Material updates are timestamped and incorporated with visible revision history.
4. Conflicts of interest are disclosed when relevant to the reporting scope.
5. Anonymous sources are used only when disclosure could cause retaliation or legal risk.

## Evidence Discipline

- Public records are linked directly where available.
- Quotations are checked against source material before publication.
- For technical claims, reproducible references are preferred over secondary summaries.
