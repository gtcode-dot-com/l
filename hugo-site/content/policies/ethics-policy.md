# Ethics Policy

## Independence

Oahu Underground reporting is produced independently and is not directed by political parties, corporations, or government bodies.

## Source Protection

- Sensitive contact is routed through minimal-disclosure intake.
- Potentially identifying details are withheld unless necessary for verification and publication.
- Secure follow-up channels are arranged where needed.

## Fairness

- Subjects are described using verifiable evidence.
- Distinctions are maintained between documented fact, analysis, and allegation.
- Where appropriate, subjects are given a chance to comment before publication.

## Harm Reduction

When publication could create avoidable harm, details are assessed for public-interest necessity before release.
