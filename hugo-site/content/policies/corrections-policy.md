# Corrections Policy

Accuracy is treated as an ongoing obligation.

## How Corrections Work

1. Reported factual errors are reviewed against source material.
2. Confirmed errors are corrected in-page as soon as practicable.
3. Substantive corrections include a dated correction note.
4. Clarifications may be added when wording is technically correct but likely to mislead.

## What To Send

Include the page URL, the specific statement in question, and supporting evidence.
