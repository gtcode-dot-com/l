grid_description: "Each issue of Oʻahu Underground takes publicly available records and shows what they look like laid next to each other. Financial disclosures, board rosters, donor lists, court filings — the network isn't hidden, it's just that nobody with a masthead has any incentive to draw the lines between the dots."
