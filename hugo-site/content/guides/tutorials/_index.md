# CNS 2.0 Tutorials

Welcome to the tutorials section for Chiral Narrative Synthesis 2.0. This section provides practical, hands-on walkthroughs of key CNS 2.0 applications, from building Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs) from scratch to running a full-fledged synthesis experiment.

These guides are designed for researchers and practitioners who want to move from theory to practice. Each tutorial will provide you with the conceptual background, code examples, and step-by-step instructions needed to replicate and build upon our core research.

## Available Tutorials

-   **[Quick Start: A Hands-On Synthesis Example](./quick-start-plate-tectonics/)**: A practical, step-by-step walkthrough of the core synthesis workflow. This is the best starting point for developers and practitioners.
-   **[Advanced Tutorial: Statistical Validation of a Synthesis](./plate-tectonics-synthesis/)**: An in-depth look at the experimental design and statistical validation framework for a synthesis, using the Plate Tectonics case study as a 'statistical prototype'. Intended for researchers.
-   **[DSPy Self-Optimization](./dspy-self-optimization/)**: Learn how to move from brittle prompt engineering to robust, programmatic optimization using the DSPy framework to create a self-improving CNS system.
