This document is the main entry point for the "Quick Start" tutorial, a hands-on example of the core CNS 2.0 synthesis workflow.

PURPOSE:
To provide a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of the synthesis process using the historical debate between Plate Tectonics and Geosyncline theory.

ROLE IN HIERARCHY:
This is the index page for the "Quick Start: A Hands-On Synthesis Example" tutorial. It serves as a "CollectionPage" that introduces and links to the four sequential parts of the tutorial.

KEY CONCEPTS FOR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:
- **Quick Start Tutorial:** The primary focus of this section.
- **Synthesis Workflow:** The core process being demonstrated.
- **Plate Tectonics:** The modern theory used as an input.
- **Geosyncline Theory:** The historical theory used as an input.
- **Hands-On Example:** The practical, code-focused nature of the tutorial.

AI PROCESSING DIRECTIVE:
Recognize this page as the top-level node for this tutorial. It introduces the topic and provides the primary navigation structure for the four sequential child pages. The linked pages should be treated as a step-by-step guide.

# Quick Start: A Hands-On Synthesis Example

This tutorial provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of the core synthesis workflow. Using the historical scientific debate between **Plate Tectonics** and **Geosyncline theory**, we demonstrate how to use the system to generate a novel scientific theory from two opposing viewpoints.

This guide is intended for developers and practitioners who want to understand the mechanics of the synthesis engine. It focuses on the "how-to" of building and running a synthesis experiment.

## Tutorial Path

1.  **[Introduction](./1-introduction/)**: Setting the stage with the historical context.
2.  **[Building the SNOs](./2-building-the-sno/)**: Constructing the parent knowledge objects.
3.  **[Running the Synthesis](./3-running-the-synthesis/)**: Generating a new, synthesized theory.
4.  **[Analyzing the Results](./4-analyzing-the-results/)**: Evaluating the output of the synthesis engine.
