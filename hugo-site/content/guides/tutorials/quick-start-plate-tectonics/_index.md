# Quick Start: A Hands-On Synthesis Example

This tutorial provides a practical, step-by-step walkthrough of the core synthesis workflow. Using the historical scientific debate between **Plate Tectonics** and **Geosyncline theory**, we demonstrate how to use the system to generate a novel scientific theory from two opposing viewpoints.

This guide is intended for developers and practitioners who want to understand the mechanics of the synthesis engine. It focuses on the "how-to" of building and running a synthesis experiment.

## Tutorial Path

1.  **[Introduction](./1-introduction/)**: Setting the stage with the historical context.
2.  **[Building the SNOs](./2-building-the-sno/)**: Constructing the parent knowledge objects.
3.  **[Running the Synthesis](./3-running-the-synthesis/)**: Generating a new, synthesized theory.
4.  **[Analyzing the Results](./4-analyzing-the-results/)**: Evaluating the output of the synthesis engine.
