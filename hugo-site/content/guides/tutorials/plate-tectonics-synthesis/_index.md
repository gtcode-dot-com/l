# Tutorial: Synthesizing the Plate Tectonics Debate

This tutorial provides a practical, hands-on walkthrough of a core CNS 2.0 use case: synthesizing conflicting scientific theories. We will use the historical debate between **Plate Tectonics** and the older **Geosyncline theory** as a testbed to demonstrate how the system can ingest opposing narratives and generate a novel, higher-order synthesis that aligns with the modern scientific consensus.

This is a concrete implementation of the **[Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE)](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-2-minimum-viable-experiment/)** outlined in the research roadmap.

## Tutorial Path

Follow the steps in order to complete the experiment:

1.  **[Introduction to the Case Study](./1-introduction/)**: Why this historical debate is a perfect test case for Chiral Narrative Synthesis.
2.  **[Building the Parent SNOs](./2-building-the-sno/)**: A code-heavy guide to manually constructing the Structured Narrative Objects for both theories.
3.  **[Running the Synthesis](./3-running-the-synthesis/)**: Using the `ChiralPairDetector` and `GenerativeSynthesisEngine` to create a new synthesis.
4.  **[Analyzing the Results](./4-analyzing-the-results/)**: Applying a two-part evaluation protocol (quantitative and qualitative) to validate the generated synthesis.
