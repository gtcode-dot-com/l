In this section, we will manually construct the two parent Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs) that represent the core arguments of Geosyncline Theory and Plate Tectonics. This process demonstrates how the abstract concepts of a narrative can be translated into the concrete data structures that CNS 2.0 operates on.

For this tutorial, we'll assume the existence of a hypothetical Python library, `cns_tools`, which provides the necessary classes for creating SNOs, Reasoning Graphs, and other components as defined in the **[CNS 2.0 Blueprint](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/blueprint/)**.

### Setting Up the Environment

First, let's imagine our basic imports. We need tools for creating SNOs and a mock embedding function.

```python
# Hypothetical CNS 2.0 Tools Library
from cns_tools import StructuredNarrativeObject, ReasoningGraph, EvidenceSet
from cns_tools.utils import get_text_embedding

# We'll also need a unique identifier for our evidence
import hashlib

def hash_source(text):
    return hashlib.sha256(text.encode()).hexdigest()

# --- Mock Evidence Sources ---
# In a real scenario, these would be pointers to actual documents (e.g., DOIs).
# Here, we'll use hashes of hypothetical paper titles as placeholders.

EVIDENCE_HALL_1859 = hash_source("Hall, J. (1859). Palaeontology of New York.")
EVIDENCE_DANA_1873 = hash_source("Dana, J.D. (1873). On the origin of mountains.")
EVIDENCE_DIETZ_1961 = hash_source("Dietz, R.S. (1961). Continent and Ocean Basin Evolution by Spreading of the Sea Floor.")
EVIDENCE_VINE_1963 = hash_source("Vine, F.J. & Matthews, D.H. (1963). Magnetic Anomalies over Oceanic Ridges.")
EVIDENCE_WILSON_1965 = hash_source("Wilson, J.T. (1965). A new class of faults and their bearing on continental drift.")
```

### 1. Building `SNO_Geosyncline`

This SNO represents the classical, pre-1960s view of geology.

**Hypothesis:** Mountain ranges are formed by the vertical collapse and uplift of large, sediment-filled troughs (geosynclines) on a static, cooling Earth.

```python
# 1. Define the Hypothesis Embedding
# In a real system, this would be generated by a sophisticated language model.
hypothesis_geosyncline = "Mountain ranges are formed by the vertical collapse and uplift of large, sediment-filled troughs (geosynclines) on a static, cooling Earth."
H_geosyncline = get_text_embedding(hypothesis_geosyncline)

# 2. Build the Reasoning Graph (G)
G_geosyncline = ReasoningGraph(graph_id="G_Geo_v1")

# Add claims (nodes) to the graph
G_geosyncline.add_claim("c1", "The Earth is a cooling and contracting body.")
G_geosyncline.add_claim("c2", "Thick sedimentary deposits accumulate in large troughs (geosynclines).")
G_geosyncline.add_claim("c3", "The crust buckles under the sediment weight and compressional forces from cooling.")
G_geosyncline.add_claim("c4", "This buckling leads to vertical uplift, forming mountain ranges.")
G_geosyncline.add_claim("c5", "Continents and ocean basins are permanent, fixed features.")

# Add reasoning relationships (edges) between claims
G_geosyncline.add_edge("c1", "c3", "supports") # Cooling earth supports buckling
G_geosyncline.add_edge("c2", "c3", "supports") # Sediment accumulation supports buckling
G_geosyncline.add_edge("c3", "c4", "implies")  # Buckling implies uplift
G_geosyncline.add_edge("c5", "c1", "is_consistent_with") # Fixed continents are consistent with a simple cooling model

# 3. Populate the Evidence Set (E)
E_geosyncline = EvidenceSet(evidence_id="E_Geo_v1")
E_geosyncline.add_evidence(EVIDENCE_HALL_1859, "Supports the existence of thick sedimentary layers in mountain belts.", supports_claims=["c2"])
E_geosyncline.add_evidence(EVIDENCE_DANA_1873, "Provides a mechanism for compression and uplift.", supports_claims=["c3", "c4"])

# 4. Instantiate the SNO
# The Trust Score (T) is initially null, as it will be assigned by the Critic Pipeline.
SNO_geosyncline = StructuredNarrativeObject(
    hypothesis_embedding=H_geosyncline,
    reasoning_graph=G_geosyncline,
    evidence_set=E_geosyncline,
    trust_score=None # To be computed later
)

print("SNO_Geosyncline created successfully.")
```

### 2. Building `SNO_PlateTectonics`

This SNO represents the modern, revolutionary view.

**Hypothesis:** The Earth's surface is composed of rigid lithospheric plates that move, and their interactions at boundaries are the primary cause of mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanism.

```python
# 1. Define the Hypothesis Embedding
hypothesis_tectonics = "The Earth's surface is composed of rigid lithospheric plates that move, and their interactions at boundaries are the primary cause of mountain building, earthquakes, and volcanism."
H_tectonics = get_text_embedding(hypothesis_tectonics)

# 2. Build the Reasoning Graph (G)
G_tectonics = ReasoningGraph(graph_id="G_PT_v1")

# Add claims (nodes)
G_tectonics.add_claim("c1", "The lithosphere is divided into rigid plates.")
G_tectonics.add_claim("c2", "New oceanic crust is generated at mid-ocean ridges (seafloor spreading).")
G_tectonics.add_claim("c3", "Oceanic crust is consumed at subduction zones.")
G_tectonics.add_claim("c4", "Plate motion is driven by mantle convection.")
G_tectonics.add_claim("c5", "Mountain ranges are formed by the collision of continental plates or subduction.")
G_tectonics.add_claim("c6", "The continents are not fixed but drift over time.")

# Add reasoning relationships (edges)
G_tectonics.add_edge("c2", "c1", "supports")
G_tectonics.add_edge("c3", "c1", "supports")
G_tectonics.add_edge("c1", "c5", "implies")
G_tectonics.add_edge("c4", "c1", "provides_mechanism_for")
G_tectonics.add_edge("c2", "c6", "implies") # Seafloor spreading implies continental drift

# This is a key point of conflict with the other SNO
G_tectonics.add_claim("c7_conflict", "Continents and ocean basins are NOT permanent, fixed features.")
G_tectonics.add_edge("c6", "c7_conflict", "implies")

# 3. Populate the Evidence Set (E)
E_tectonics = EvidenceSet(evidence_id="E_PT_v1")
E_tectonics.add_evidence(EVIDENCE_DIETZ_1961, "Proposes the mechanism of seafloor spreading.", supports_claims=["c2"])
E_tectonics.add_evidence(EVIDENCE_VINE_1963, "Symmetrical magnetic stripes around mid-ocean ridges provide strong proof of seafloor spreading.", supports_claims=["c2"])
E_tectonics.add_evidence(EVIDENCE_WILSON_1965, "Identifies transform faults, a necessary component of plate boundary interactions.", supports_claims=["c1", "c5"])

# 4. Instantiate the SNO
SNO_plate_tectonics = StructuredNarrativeObject(
    hypothesis_embedding=H_tectonics,
    reasoning_graph=G_tectonics,
    evidence_set=E_tectonics,
    trust_score=None # To be computed later
)

print("SNO_PlateTectonics created successfully.")
```

With these two SNOs constructed, we now have two well-defined, opposing, and computationally tractable narratives. They are ready to be analyzed and fed into the synthesis engine, which we will cover in the next part of this tutorial.
