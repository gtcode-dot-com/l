## The Perfect Test Case: A Resolved Scientific Debate

To demonstrate the power of Chiral Narrative Synthesis, we need more than a toy problem. We need a real-world example of two powerful, compelling, and ultimately conflicting narratives that vied to explain a complex set of phenomena. Crucially, this debate must now be resolved, giving us a "ground truth" against which we can compare our generated synthesis.

The historical conflict between **Geosyncline Theory** and **Plate Tectonics** provides a perfect testbed. This is the exact scenario described in the **[Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE)](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-2-minimum-viable-experiment/)** of the CNS 2.0 Research Roadmap.

### The Competing Narratives

-   **Geosyncline Theory (Prevailing view, ~1850s-1960s):** This theory proposed that the Earth's crust was static. Mountain ranges were formed by the vertical uplift and collapse of massive, sediment-filled troughs called "geosynclines," driven by a cooling, contracting Earth. It was a comprehensive narrative that attempted to explain a wide range of geological observations with a single, unified mechanism.

-   **Plate Tectonics (Revolutionary theory, 1960s-Present):** This theory proposed a dynamic Earth, where the lithosphere is broken into a small number of rigid plates that move relative to one another. It explained mountain formation, earthquakes, and volcanism through the interactions at plate boundaries (convergence, divergence, and transform).

### Why It's Ideal for CNS 2.0

This historical debate is an ideal candidate for our first tutorial for several reasons:

1.  **High Chirality and Entanglement:** Both theories were well-supported by evidence available at the time, and they were fundamentally opposed (`high CScore`). Crucially, they were trying to explain the *same set of facts*â€”the existence of mountain ranges, the distribution of earthquakes, the shape of continents (`high EScore`). This is the fertile ground CNS 2.0 is designed to explore.
2.  **Resolved Conflict:** We know how this story ends. Plate Tectonics provided a more comprehensive and powerful explanatory framework, incorporating the valid observations of geosyncline theory while resolving its core contradictions. This gives us a clear "gold standard" to evaluate our synthesized narrative against.
3.  **Complex, Structured Arguments:** Both theories were complex systems of claims, evidence, and reasoning, making them perfect for representation as Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs).

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of manually creating SNOs for both theories, running them through the CNS 2.0 synthesis engine, and analyzing the result to see if our system can rediscover the modern scientific consensus.
