# Tutorial: Self-Optimizing Systems with DSPy

This tutorial demonstrates how to evolve a CNS 2.0 module from a system reliant on brittle, hand-crafted "prompt engineering" to a robust, self-optimizing program using the **DSPy framework**. We will focus on building a synthesis module that can programmatically learn to generate better prompts by using its own **CNS Critic Pipeline** as a quality metric.

This approach is a cornerstone of the advanced vision for CNS 2.0, creating a system that can adapt and improve its own reasoning capabilities over time. For more detail, see **[Chapter 7 of the Developer's Guide](/guides/building-cns-2.0-developers-guide/chapter-7-dspy-integration/)**.

## Tutorial Path

Follow the steps in order:

1.  **[Introduction: From Prompts to Programs](./1-introduction/)**: Understanding the limitations of prompt engineering and the paradigm shift offered by DSPy.
2.  **[Defining the Task for DSPy](./2-defining-the-task/)**: How to set up the core components: the Signature, the Metric, and the training Examples.
3.  **[Running the DSPy Optimizer](./3-running-the-optimizer/)**: Using the DSPy compiler to automatically generate and optimize a powerful synthesis prompt.
4.  **[Analyzing the Optimized Module](./4-analyzing-the-optimized.module/)**: Inspecting the results, comparing the optimized prompt to a naive one, and seeing the performance difference.
