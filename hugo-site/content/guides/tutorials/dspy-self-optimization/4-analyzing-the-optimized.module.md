KEY CONCEPTS FOR SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:
- Optimized Prompt
- Performance Comparison
- Few-Shot Examples
- Chain-of-Thought Reasoning
- Self-Optimization Benefits

AI PROCESSING DIRECTIVE:
Recognize this file as the concluding chapter of a tutorial. It provides the "proof" of the concepts introduced in the previous steps by showing a side-by-side comparison of the results.

After the DSPy compiler has finished its work, we are left with a new, optimized `compiled_synthesis_module`. But what has actually changed? And does it perform any better? In this final section, we'll inspect the results and run a comparison.

### 1. Inspecting the Generated Prompt

The core output of the `BootstrapFewShot` optimizer is a new, highly-optimized prompt. We can inspect the prompt of our compiled module to see what it has learned.

```python
# Let's assume 'lm' is our configured language model and 
# 'compiled_synthesis_module' is the output from the previous step.

# lm.inspect_history(n=1) will show the last prompt sent to the LLM.
# To see the full prompt, we can call the module and then inspect.
# We'll create a new test example for this.
test_example = dspy.Example(
    thesis="Economic growth is primarily driven by consumer spending (demand-side economics).",
    antithesis="Economic growth is primarily driven by production and investment (supply-side economics).",
    shared_evidence="Shared evidence includes government spending data, consumer confidence indices, records of tax cuts on corporations, and historical GDP growth rates."
)

# Run the compiled module on our test example
compiled_synthesis_module(
    thesis=test_example.thesis, 
    antithesis=test_example.antithesis, 
    shared_evidence=test_example.shared_evidence
)

# Now inspect the last prompt sent to the language model
lm.inspect_history(n=1)
```

#### Naive Prompt vs. Optimized Prompt

A naive, hand-written prompt for our `ChainOfThought` module might look something like this:

> **Naive Prompt:**
>
> Given the thesis, antithesis, and shared evidence, think step-by-step to synthesize a novel hypothesis that resolves the core contradiction.
>
> --
>
> **Thesis:** {thesis}
>
> **Antithesis:** {antithesis}
>
> **Shared Evidence:** {shared_evidence}
>
> **Synthesized Hypothesis:**

However, after running `optimizer.compile()`, the prompt inside our `compiled_synthesis_module` will be far more sophisticated. It will have been automatically generated by the optimizer because this structure was found to maximize our `critic_pipeline_metric`. It will look something like this (this is a simplified representation):

> **Optimized Prompt (Generated by DSPy):**
>
> **Synthesizes a novel, higher-order hypothesis from two opposing narratives (a thesis and an antithesis) that are grounded in a shared set of evidence. The synthesis must reconcile the conflict and explain the same evidence.**
>
> --
>
> **Follow these steps:**
> 1.  Analyze the core contradiction between the thesis and antithesis.
> 2.  Identify the key elements of the shared evidence that must be explained.
> 3.  Formulate a new, unifying theory that preserves the valid points of both narratives while resolving the main conflict.
>
> --
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> **Thesis:** The continents are fixed in place...
>
> **Antithesis:** The continents drift across the Earth's surface...
>
> **Shared Evidence:** ...jigsaw-puzzle fit of continents...
>
> **Reasoning:** The user wants a synthesis that reconciles fixed continents with drifting ones. The evidence points to plate tectonics. I will formulate a hypothesis that explains both the apparent stability and the underlying motion by introducing the concept of rigid plates.
>
> **Synthesized Hypothesis:** A unifying theory of plate tectonics reconciles these views...
>
> --
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> **Thesis:** Light is composed of particles...
>
> **Antithesis:** Light is a wave...
>
> **Shared Evidence:** ...light travels in straight lines...but also exhibits diffraction...
>
> **Reasoning:** The user needs to resolve the particle-wave conflict. The evidence supports both behaviors. I will propose a dual-nature model where light has properties of both, which is the concept of wave-particle duality.
>
> **Synthesized Hypothesis:** A new model of wave-particle duality reconciles the conflict...
>
> --
>
> **Current Task:**
>
> **Thesis:** {thesis}
>
> **Antithesis:** {antithesis}
>
> **Shared Evidence:** {shared_evidence}
>
> **Reasoning:**

The optimized prompt is a much more powerful guide for the LLM. It includes explicit instructions, a chain-of-thought directive (`Reasoning:`), and, most importantly, **few-shot examples** that were automatically selected from our `trainset` by the optimizer because they helped produce high-quality outputs.

### 2. Comparing Performance on a New Example

Now for the real test. Let's run both our original, un-optimized module and our new, compiled module on the `test_example` we created earlier and see how they perform.

```python
# Get the prediction from the un-optimized module
uncompiled_pred = uncompiled_synthesis_module(
    thesis=test_example.thesis, 
    antithesis=test_example.antithesis, 
    shared_evidence=test_example.shared_evidence
)

# Get the prediction from the compiled module
compiled_pred = compiled_synthesis_module(
    thesis=test_example.thesis, 
    antithesis=test_example.antithesis, 
    shared_evidence=test_example.shared_evidence
)

# Let's see the outputs
print("--- Uncompiled Output ---")
print(uncompiled_pred.synthesized_hypothesis)
print("\n--- Compiled Output ---")
print(compiled_pred.synthesized_hypothesis)

# And let's score them with our metric
uncompiled_score = critic_pipeline_metric(test_example, uncompiled_pred)
compiled_score = critic_pipeline_metric(test_example, compiled_pred)

print(f"\nUncompiled Module Score: {uncompiled_score}")
print(f"Compiled Module Score: {compiled_score}")
```

We would expect to see a significant difference.
-   The **uncompiled output** might be simplistic, perhaps just averaging the two ideas (e.g., "Both supply and demand are important for the economy.").
-   The **compiled output**, guided by its superior prompt, is much more likely to produce a sophisticated synthesis (e.g., "A new model suggesting that economic growth is a dynamic interplay where demand-side stimulus is effective in the short-run to utilize capacity, while long-run growth depends on supply-side investment to expand that capacity.").

The scores from our `critic_pipeline_metric` would reflect this difference in quality.

### 3. Conclusion: The Power of Self-Optimization

This tutorial has demonstrated the core principle of building self-optimizing systems with DSPy. By moving from manual prompt engineering to programmatic optimization, we gain several key advantages:
-   **Robustness:** The optimized prompt is far more reliable across a wider range of inputs because it has been explicitly taught what a good output looks like.
-   **Adaptability:** If we change our underlying LLM, we don't need to re-write our prompts by hand. We simply re-run the `compile()` step, and DSPy will find the new optimal prompt for the new model.
-   **Principled Design:** Our system's performance is driven by a clearly defined metric (our `CriticPipeline`), making the optimization process transparent and aligned with our project's core values.

This self-optimization loop—where the system's own critics are used to improve its own generative components—is a foundational concept for building the next generation of powerful, reliable, and adaptive AI reasoning systems like CNS 2.0.
