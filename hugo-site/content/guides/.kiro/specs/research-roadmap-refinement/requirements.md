# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical refinement of the CNS 2.0 Research Roadmap to transform it from an LLM-generated draft into a PhD-level, publication-ready research program. The current roadmap suffers from excessive filler content, over-reliance on list formatting, and lacks the statistical rigor necessary for legitimate scientific validation. This refinement will establish a world-class research framework that embodies scientific methodology rather than merely describing it.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Content Quality Enhancement

**User Story:** As a research reviewer, I want to read a concise, substantive research roadmap that eliminates redundant filler language, so that I can quickly assess the scientific merit and feasibility of the proposed research program.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any chapter THEN the content SHALL contain no more than 10% filler words or phrases that do not directly support the research objectives
2. WHEN encountering explanatory text THEN it SHALL be written at PhD-level academic standards with precise technical language
3. WHEN reading section introductions THEN they SHALL eliminate phrases like "this is a research roadmap" and similar meta-commentary
4. WHEN reviewing list structures THEN they SHALL be converted to narrative prose where appropriate without disrupting core organizational structure
5. IF a list format is retained THEN it SHALL serve a specific functional purpose beyond simple enumeration

### Requirement 2: Statistical Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a PhD statistician, I want to see a mathematically rigorous experimental design that scales beyond single examples, so that I can validate the statistical significance and reproducibility of the research findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the plate tectonics example THEN it SHALL be positioned as the manual prototype for automated generation of statistically significant sample sizes
2. WHEN examining the experimental methodology THEN it SHALL implement the standard 'Experimental Validation Protocol' template which includes formulations for sample size, power analysis, and significance testing
3. WHEN evaluating the validation approach THEN it SHALL specify concrete statistical measures (effect sizes, confidence intervals, p-values) for each research phase
4. WHEN reviewing the DSPy integration THEN it SHALL demonstrate how automated example generation will achieve statistical significance across all four research phases
5. IF statistical methods are presented THEN they SHALL be expressed in simple, consumable mathematical notation that reviewers can immediately recognize as scientifically valid

### Requirement 3: Implementation-Research Integration

**User Story:** As a research program director, I want to see seamless integration between the theoretical research roadmap and practical implementation capabilities, so that I can assess the feasibility and resource requirements for executing this research program.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing research phases THEN each SHALL explicitly reference corresponding implementation components from the developer's guide
2. WHEN examining experimental designs THEN they SHALL specify how DSPy optimization will be used to validate and refine research hypotheses
3. WHEN evaluating resource requirements THEN the roadmap SHALL provide realistic timelines and technical prerequisites for each research thrust
4. WHEN reviewing validation protocols THEN they SHALL leverage the self-optimizing capabilities described in the developer's guide
5. IF implementation details are referenced THEN they SHALL demonstrate how the production system capabilities enable rigorous scientific experimentation
