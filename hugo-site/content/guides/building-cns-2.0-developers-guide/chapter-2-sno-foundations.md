# Chapter 2: SNO Foundations

## Understanding Structured Narrative Objects

Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs) are the heart of CNS 2.0. Unlike simple vector representations that lose critical structural information, SNOs preserve the full richness of argumentative structure while maintaining computational tractability.

An SNO is formally defined as a 4-tuple: **ùíÆ = (H, G, ‚Ñ∞, T)** where:

- **H**: Hypothesis Embedding (dense vector)
- **G**: Reasoning Graph (directed acyclic graph)
- **‚Ñ∞**: Evidence Set (grounding data sources)
- **T**: Trust Score (derived confidence measure)

### From Paper to Code: The Mathematical Foundation

First, let's look at the formal definition from the paper. Section 2.1 defines a Structured Narrative Object as a mathematical construct.

> **Definition 2.1 (Structured Narrative Object)**
> An SNO is a 4-tuple $\mathcal{S} = (H, G, \mathcal{E}, T)$ where:
> - **Hypothesis Embedding** $H \in \mathbb{R}^d$: A $d$-dimensional dense vector encoding the narrative's central claim, enabling geometric similarity computations while preserving semantic content
> - **Reasoning Graph** $G = (V, E_G)$: A directed acyclic graph with vertices $V$ representing sub-claims and edges $E_G \subseteq V \times V \times \mathcal{R}$ encoding typed logical relationships (e.g., "supports," "contradicts," "implies") from the relation set $\mathcal{R}$
> - **Evidence Set** $\mathcal{E} = \{e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n\}$: Pointers to grounding data sources, including document identifiers, data hashes, or persistent identifiers (DOIs), establishing verifiable connections to primary sources
> - **Trust Score** $T \in [0, 1]$: A derived confidence measure computed by the critic pipeline, not an intrinsic property of the narrative

**From Paper to Code:**

Our `StructuredNarrativeObject` Python class is the direct, practical implementation of this mathematical 4-tuple. Let's map the theory to our code:

- **`H` (Hypothesis Embedding):** This corresponds to the `self.hypothesis_embedding` attribute in our class. It's an optional `np.ndarray` that will hold the dense vector representation of the SNO's central claim, calculated by the `compute_hypothesis_embedding` method.
- **`G` (Reasoning Graph):** This is implemented as `self.reasoning_graph`, a `networkx.DiGraph` object. The vertices `V` are the nodes added via `add_claim`, and the edges `E_G` are the relationships added with `add_reasoning_edge`. The paper's requirement that it be a *directed acyclic graph* is enforced by our check for cycles within the `add_reasoning_edge` method.
- **`‚Ñ∞` (Evidence Set):** This is our `self.evidence_set`, a Python `set` containing `EvidenceItem` objects. This perfectly matches the definition of a collection of pointers to grounding data.
- **`T` (Trust Score):** This is the `self.trust_score` attribute. As the paper states, it is "not an intrinsic property" but is "derived," which is why it's initialized as `None` and will be populated later by our `CriticPipeline`.

Understanding this mapping is key. We're not just creating a data class; we're instantiating a formal mathematical object described in the paper.

#### A Note on Embeddings
For the mathematical primitives like the Chirality Score and Novelty Score to work as intended, we need a semantically meaningful vector space. Simple fallbacks like hash-based vectors produce random outputs that destroy any geometric meaning, rendering the core CNS 2.0 mechanics useless. Therefore, our implementation treats a real embedding model as a mandatory component.
