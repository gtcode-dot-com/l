# Chapter 5: System Integration

## Assembling the Autonomous System

Now that we've implemented the core components—SNOs, Critics, and the Synthesis Engine—it's time to integrate them into a cohesive, stateful, and autonomous system. This chapter focuses on the operational workflow that allows the CNS 2.0 system to run continuously, processing information and refining its knowledge base over time.

We will build a `CNSWorkflowManager` that serves as the central nervous system, orchestrating the flow of data and tasks between all other components.

## The `asyncio` Architecture for I/O-Bound Systems

For our initial implementation, we will use Python's `asyncio` library. This is a deliberate design choice well-suited to the specific challenges of the CNS 2.0 system, whose primary performance bottlenecks are **I/O-bound** (Input/Output bound), not CPU-bound. The system spends most of its time *waiting* for:
-   Network requests to LLM APIs (for grounding or synthesis).
-   Reading/writing to a database for persistence.
-   Loading large model files from disk.

### Why `asyncio` is Efficient

`asyncio` uses a cooperative multitasking model called an **event loop**. When a task performs an I/O operation (like an API call), it tells the event loop, "I'm going to be waiting for a while." Instead of letting the CPU sit idle, the event loop immediately switches to another task that is ready to do work. This results in a massive increase in throughput.

| Synchronous Execution (Inefficient) | Asynchronous Execution (Efficient) |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1. Start API call for Task A. | 1. Start API call for Task A. |
| 2. **CPU waits idly** for response. | 2. While A waits, start API call for Task B. |
| 3. API call A finishes. | 3. While B waits, start API call for Task C. |
| 4. Start API call for Task B. | 4. API call A finishes. Process result A. |
| 5. **CPU waits idly** for response. | 5. API call C finishes. Process result C. |
| 6. API call B finishes. | 6. API call B finishes. Process result B. |

The asynchronous model completes the same work in a fraction of the time by eliminating CPU idle time.

### The `CNSWorkflowManager` Implementation

Our `CNSWorkflowManager` uses an `asyncio.Queue` as a central "to-do list." A single background worker continuously pulls tasks from this queue and processes them.

## Actionable Monitoring for System Health

An autonomous system should not be a "black box." Continuous monitoring is essential. A dashboard (using tools like Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog) should track key metrics, and you should know how to interpret them.

### System Performance Metrics

-   **Task Queue Size**
    -   **What it means**: The number of tasks waiting to be processed.
    -   **Actionable Insight**: If this number is constantly increasing, your ingestion rate is higher than your processing rate. This is a primary indicator that you need to scale up your workers (see Chapter 6) or optimize the performance of your critics. A healthy system's queue size should hover around zero.

-   **Task Processing Latency**
    -   **What it means**: The average time from when a task enters the queue to when it is completed.
    -   **Actionable Insight**: Spikes in this metric can point to performance bottlenecks. For example, if latency spikes after you deploy a new NLI model for the `GroundingCritic`, that model is likely less efficient than the previous one.

### Knowledge Quality and Dynamics Metrics

-   **Average Trust Score**
    -   **What it means**: The mean trust score of all SNOs in your population.
    -   **Actionable Insight**: A healthy, learning system should show a slowly but steadily increasing average trust score over time, as weaker narratives are replaced by more robust, synthesized ones. A stagnant or decreasing score might indicate a problem with your synthesis prompts, critic weights, or the quality of your source data.

-   **Synthesis Success Rate**
    -   **What it means**: The percentage of synthesized candidate SNOs that pass the critic evaluation and are added to the population.
    -   **Actionable Insight**: A very low rate (<10%) might indicate that your synthesis prompts are not effective or that your `synthesis_thresholds` for chirality and entanglement are too low, leading to low-quality pairings. You can use this metric to tune your synthesis prompts and selection criteria.

-   **Critic Score Distribution**
    -   **What it means**: A histogram showing the distribution of scores (0.0 to 1.0) for each individual critic (Grounding, Logic, Novelty).
    -   **Actionable Insight**: This helps you understand the system's "biases." Is your system producing highly logical but unoriginal ideas? The `Novelty` score distribution would be skewed low. Is it producing novel but poorly supported ideas? The `Grounding` score distribution would be skewed low. This insight allows you to adjust the critic weights (`w_i`) to guide the system toward a more balanced state of knowledge.

By tracking these metrics, you gain crucial, actionable visibility into the system's operational health and its effectiveness at the core task of knowledge synthesis.
