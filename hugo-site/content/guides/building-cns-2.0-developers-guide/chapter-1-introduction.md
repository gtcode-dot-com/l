# Chapter 1: Introduction to CNS 2.0

## The Challenge of Conflicting Information

Complex domains—from scientific research to intelligence analysis—require synthesizing incomplete, uncertain, and contradictory information into coherent knowledge. Despite AI's success in pattern recognition, the cognitive challenge of reconciling conflicting hypotheses remains unsolved. This challenge stems from the inherent complexity of argumentation, where claims exist within intricate webs of evidence and reasoning that resist simple computational approaches.

This guide provides the practical engineering blueprint for **Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) 2.0**, translating the formal research paper into a working system. We will build, step-by-step, a framework that operationalizes knowledge synthesis by treating hypotheses as mathematically evaluable data structures rather than simple text.

## Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is designed for developers, researchers, and engineers who are interested in building sophisticated AI systems for knowledge synthesis. It is for you if:

- You are a **Python developer** looking to implement advanced, research-grade AI concepts.
- You are a **researcher** in NLP or AI who wants to move from theory to a practical, working implementation.
- You are an **engineer** tasked with building systems that can reason about and reconcile conflicting data sources.

A strong understanding of Python is required, and familiarity with core machine learning concepts (like embeddings) and libraries (like NumPy) will be highly beneficial. While we will explain the CNS-specific concepts in detail, this guide is not a general introduction to AI or Python programming.

## Core Innovations

Moving beyond the naive vector averaging of traditional approaches, CNS 2.0 introduces four key advances, consistent with the formal research paper:

1.  **Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs):** Rich data structures capturing hypotheses, logical reasoning graphs, evidence sets, and trust scores.
2.  **Multi-Component Critic Pipeline:** Transparent evaluation replacing black-box oracles with specialized assessors for grounding, logic, and novelty.
3.  **Generative Synthesis Engine:** LLM-powered dialectical reasoning that transcends naive vector averaging.
4.  **Evidential Entanglement Metric:** A novel measure identifying narratives that oppose each other while arguing over shared evidence.

## The CNS 2.0 Workflow at a Glance

To understand how these components work together, let's visualize the complete system workflow. The system operates in a continuous, cyclical process of ingestion, evaluation, and synthesis.

</div>

This diagram illustrates how raw information is transformed into structured knowledge, which is then refined through a dialectical process that pits competing narratives against each other to generate novel, more robust insights. The key stages are:
1.  **Narrative Ingestion:** Unstructured text is converted into a formal `StructuredNarrativeObject` (SNO), a process known as argumentation mining.
2.  **SNO Population:** The system maintains a collection of all known SNOs, forming its knowledge base.
3.  **Chiral Pair Selection:** The system actively searches the population for pairs of SNOs that are both highly contradictory (`Chirality`) and argue over the same evidence (`Entanglement`). These are the most productive conflicts to resolve.
4.  **Generative Synthesis:** The selected pair is passed to an LLM, which is prompted to perform dialectical reasoning and generate a new, higher-order SNO that resolves the conflict.
5.  **Critic Evaluation:** The newly synthesized SNO is rigorously evaluated by the multi-component critic pipeline. If its `Trust Score` is high enough, it is added to the population, representing new knowledge. If not, it is archived.

## Setting Up the CNS 2.0 Environment

We will now establish the Python environment for our implementation. We'll start with the foundational data structures, then handle imports, and finally define a centralized configuration class to manage all system parameters.

### Foundational Data Structures

Before we build the full `StructuredNarrativeObject` in the next chapter, we need two simple but crucial building blocks: `RelationType` and `EvidenceItem`. These `dataclasses` ensure our code is readable, type-safe, and consistent.

```python
# --- Standard Library Imports ---
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
import hashlib

class RelationType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of logical relationship types in reasoning graphs.
    This corresponds to the relation set R in the paper's definition
    of a reasoning graph G = (V, E_G) where E_G is a set of typed edges.
    """
    SUPPORTS = "supports"
    CONTRADICTS = "contradicts"
    IMPLIES = "implies"
    WEAKENS = "weakens"
    EXPLAINS = "explains"
    GENERALIZES = "generalizes"

@dataclass
class EvidenceItem:
    """
    Represents a piece of evidence, corresponding to an element e_i in
    the Evidence Set E from the paper. Includes source tracking and a
    content hash for integrity.
    """
    content: str
    source_id: str  # e.g., a DOI, URL, or document ID
    doc_hash: Optional[str] = None
    confidence: float = 1.0
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        """Generate a content hash after the object is initialized."""
        if self.doc_hash is None:
            self.doc_hash = hashlib.sha256(self.content.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]

```

### Core System Imports

Next, we set up the necessary imports for the entire system. A research-grade implementation relies on semantic understanding, which requires libraries like `transformers` and `sentence-transformers`. We include a check to ensure these are installed, allowing the system to run in a simplified, data-structure-only mode if they are missing.

```python
# --- Standard Library Imports ---
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Set, Union
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# --- Core Scientific Computing and Graph Libraries ---
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

# --- Machine Learning and NLP Libraries ---
try:
    import torch
    import transformers
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    HAS_TRANSFORMERS = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_TRANSFORMERS = False
    print("WARNING: Key NLP libraries not found. CNS 2.0 will run in a simplified, data-structure-only mode.")
    print("For full research-grade functionality, install with: pip install torch transformers sentence-transformers")

if not HAS_TRANSFORMERS:
    print("Proceeding in simplified mode. Any operations requiring semantic embeddings will fail.")
```

### System Configuration

A robust system requires a centralized place to manage key parameters. The `CNSConfig` class serves this purpose. Each parameter is directly tied to a core concept in the CNS 2.0 research paper, allowing us to easily tune the system's behavior.

```python
class CNSConfig:
    """
    Configuration class for all CNS 2.0 system parameters.
    Centralizing configuration makes the system easier to tune and manage. Each parameter
    maps directly to a concept in the formal research paper.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # --- Embedding Model ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.1, Hypothesis Embedding H ∈ R^d
        # The dimension 'd' of the vectors used to represent text semantically.
        # This MUST match the output dimension of the chosen embedding model.
        # For 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', this is 384. For 'all-mpnet-base-v2', it's 768.
        self.embedding_dim = 384
        
        # --- Critic Pipeline Weights ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.2, Equation 1: Reward(S) = Σ w_i * Score_i(S)
        # These are the weights 'w_i' that define the system's "values". They control
        # the balance between evidential support (grounding), logical coherence, and originality.
        self.critic_weights = {
            'grounding': 0.4,
            'logic': 0.3,
            'novelty': 0.3
        }
        
        # --- Novelty-Parsimony Critic Parameters ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.2, Score_N formula
        # These are the 'alpha' and 'beta' hyperparameters in the Novelty-Parsimony score.
        # alpha: Scales the reward for novelty (distance from other SNOs).
        # beta: Scales the penalty for complexity (graph size), encouraging Occam's Razor.
        self.novelty_alpha = 0.7
        self.novelty_beta = 0.3

        # --- Synthesis Trigger Thresholds ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 3.2, "Synthesis Trigger"
        # These thresholds act as a gatekeeper for the expensive synthesis process.
        # An SNO pair is only considered if BOTH its Chirality and Entanglement scores
        # exceed these minimums. This is key to balancing cost and discovery.
        self.synthesis_thresholds = {
            'chirality': 0.7,
            'entanglement': 0.5
        }
        
        # --- Model Identifiers ---
        # These are the concrete implementations for the abstract components in the paper.
        # - 'embedding': Creates the Hypothesis Embedding 'H'.
        # - 'nli': The Natural Language Inference model for the Grounding Critic.
        # - 'synthesis': The generative instruction-tuned model for the Synthesis Engine.
        self.models = {
            'embedding': "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
            'nli': "roberta-large-mnli",
            'synthesis': "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
        }

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict:
        """Convert configuration to a dictionary for easy serialization and logging."""
        return {
            'embedding_dim': self.embedding_dim,
            'critic_weights': self.critic_weights,
            'novelty_alpha': self.novelty_alpha,
            'novelty_beta': self.novelty_beta,
            'synthesis_thresholds': self.synthesis_thresholds,
            'models': self.models
        }
```

### Initializing the Environment

Finally, we create a global configuration instance to be used throughout the system and print it to confirm our setup.

```python
# Create a global configuration instance.
cns_config = CNSConfig()

print("CNS 2.0 Foundation Environment Ready")
print("Current Configuration:")
print(json.dumps(cns_config.to_dict(), indent=2))
```

This restructured setup provides a clearer, step-by-step introduction to the foundational components of the CNS 2.0 system, with explicit links back to the guiding research paper.
