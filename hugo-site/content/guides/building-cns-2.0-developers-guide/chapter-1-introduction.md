# Chapter 1: Introduction to CNS 2.0

## The Challenge: Synthesizing Contradictory Knowledge

The foundational research paper, "CNS 2.0: A Practical Blueprint for Chiral Narrative Synthesis," opens by identifying a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence:

> "Complex domains—from scientific research to intelligence analysis—require synthesizing incomplete, uncertain, and contradictory information into coherent knowledge. Despite AI's success in pattern recognition, the cognitive challenge of reconciling conflicting hypotheses remains unsolved."

This guide provides the practical engineering blueprint for **Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) 2.0**, translating that formal paper into a working Python system. We will build, step-by-step, a framework that operationalizes knowledge synthesis by treating hypotheses not as simple text, but as mathematically evaluable data structures.

## Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is designed for developers, researchers, and engineers interested in building sophisticated AI systems for knowledge synthesis. It is for you if:

- You are a **Python developer** looking to implement advanced, research-grade AI concepts.
- You are a **researcher** in NLP or AI who wants to move from theory to a practical, working implementation.
- You are an **engineer** tasked with building systems that can reason about and reconcile conflicting data sources.

A strong understanding of Python is required, and familiarity with core machine learning concepts (like embeddings) and libraries (like NumPy) will be highly beneficial.

## Core Innovations

CNS 2.0 introduces four key advances that we will implement throughout this guide:

1.  **Structured Narrative Objects (SNOs):** Rich data structures capturing hypotheses, logical reasoning graphs, evidence sets, and trust scores.
2.  **Multi-Component Critic Pipeline:** Transparent evaluation replacing black-box oracles with specialized assessors for grounding, logic, and novelty.
3.  **Generative Synthesis Engine:** LLM-powered dialectical reasoning that transcends naive vector averaging.
4.  **Evidential Entanglement Metric:** A novel measure identifying narratives that oppose each other while arguing over shared evidence.

This guide focuses on the practical implementation of these components. To explore the long-term vision and the advanced research required to push these concepts to their limits, see the **[CNS 2.0 Research Roadmap](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/)**.

## The CNS 2.0 Workflow at a Glance

The system operates in a continuous, cyclical process of ingestion, evaluation, and synthesis. This diagram illustrates how raw information is transformed into structured knowledge, which is then refined through a dialectical process that pits competing narratives against each other to generate novel, more robust insights.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/img/diagram-01.svg" alt="A diagram showing the CNS 2.0 workflow loop: Narrative Ingestion to SNO Population, then Chiral Pair Selection, Generative Synthesis, Critic Evaluation, and back to the SNO population." style="display: inline-block;" />
</div>

The key stages are:
1.  **Narrative Ingestion:** Unstructured text is converted into a formal `StructuredNarrativeObject` (SNO).
2.  **SNO Population:** The system maintains a collection of all known SNOs.
3.  **Chiral Pair Selection:** The system finds pairs of SNOs that are highly contradictory (`Chirality`) and argue over the same evidence (`Entanglement`).
4.  **Generative Synthesis:** The pair is passed to an LLM, which is prompted to perform dialectical reasoning and generate a new SNO that resolves the conflict.
5.  **Critic Evaluation:** The new SNO is rigorously evaluated by the critic pipeline. If its `Trust Score` is high enough, it is added to the population.

## Setting Up the CNS 2.0 Environment

We will now establish the Python environment for our implementation. We'll start with foundational data structures, then handle imports, and finally define a centralized configuration class to manage all system parameters.

### Foundational Data Structures

Before building the full `StructuredNarrativeObject` in the next chapter, we need two simple but crucial building blocks: `RelationType` and `EvidenceItem`. Using `dataclasses` ensures our code is readable, type-safe, and self-documenting.

```python
# --- Standard Library Imports ---
from enum import Enum
from typing import Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
import hashlib

class RelationType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of logical relationship types in reasoning graphs.

    Paper Reference: Section 2.1, Definition of Reasoning Graph G = (V, E_G).
    This enum represents the set of possible relationship types R for the
    typed edges E_G ⊆ V × V × R.
    """
    SUPPORTS = "supports"
    CONTRADICTS = "contradicts"
    IMPLIES = "implies"
    WEAKENS = "weakens"
    EXPLAINS = "explains"
    GENERALIZES = "generalizes"

@dataclass
class EvidenceItem:
    """
    Represents a single piece of evidence, corresponding to an element e_i
    in the Evidence Set E from the paper. Includes source tracking and a
    content hash for integrity.

    Paper Reference: Section 2.1, Definition of Evidence Set E = {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n}.
    """
    content: str
    source_id: str  # e.g., a DOI, URL, or document ID
    doc_hash: Optional[str] = None
    confidence: float = 1.0
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        """
        This is a special dataclass method that runs after the object is created.
        We use it here to automatically generate a SHA256 hash of the evidence
        content. This ensures that every piece of evidence has a unique, verifiable
        fingerprint, which is crucial for tracking data provenance and ensuring
        the integrity of the Evidence Set E.
        """
        if self.doc_hash is None:
            self.doc_hash = hashlib.sha256(self.content.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]

```

### Core System Imports

Next, we set up the necessary imports. A research-grade implementation relies on semantic understanding, which requires powerful NLP libraries. We include a check to ensure these are installed, allowing the system to run in a simplified, data-structure-only mode if they are missing.

```python
# --- Standard Library Imports ---
import json
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple, Set, Union
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# --- Core Scientific Computing and Graph Libraries ---
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

# --- Machine Learning and NLP Libraries ---
# These are critical for the system's semantic capabilities.
try:
    import torch
    import transformers
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    HAS_TRANSFORMERS = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_TRANSFORMERS = False
    print("WARNING: Key NLP/ML libraries (torch, transformers, sentence-transformers) not found.")
    print("CNS 2.0 will run in a simplified, data-structure-only mode.")
    print("The following components will NOT function:")
    print("- SNO.compute_hypothesis_embedding()")
    print("- GroundingCritic (requires NLI model)")
    print("- NoveltyParsimonyCritic (requires embeddings)")
    print("- ChiralPairDetector (requires embeddings)")

if HAS_TRANSFORMERS:
    print("NLP/ML libraries loaded successfully. Full functionality enabled.")
else:
    print("Proceeding in simplified mode.")
```

### System Configuration

A robust system requires a centralized place to manage key parameters. The `CNSConfig` class serves this purpose, directly mapping tunable parameters to concepts in the research paper.

```python
class CNSConfig:
    """
    Configuration class for all CNS 2.0 system parameters.
    Centralizing configuration makes the system easier to tune and manage. Each parameter
    maps directly to a concept in the formal research paper.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # --- Embedding Model ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.1, Hypothesis Embedding H ∈ R^d
        # This parameter defines 'd', the dimension of the vectors used to represent
        # text semantically. It MUST match the output dimension of the chosen
        # sentence-transformer model.
        # 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' -> d=384
        # 'all-mpnet-base-v2' -> d=768
        self.embedding_dim: int = 384
        
        # --- Critic Pipeline Weights ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.2, Equation 1: Reward(S) = Σ w_i * Score_i(S)
        # These are the weights 'w_i' that define the system's "values." They control
        # the balance between evidential support (grounding), logical coherence, and
        # originality. Adjusting these weights allows for context-sensitive evaluation.
        self.critic_weights: Dict[str, float] = {
            'grounding': 0.4,
            'logic': 0.3,
            'novelty': 0.3
        }
        
        # --- Novelty-Parsimony Critic Parameters ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 2.2, Score_N formula:
        # Score_N = α * min_i ||H - H_i||₂ - β * (|E_G| / |V|)
        # These are the 'α' and 'β' hyperparameters in the Novelty-Parsimony score.
        self.novelty_alpha: float = 0.7  # 'α': Scales the reward for novelty (distance from other SNOs).
        self.novelty_beta: float = 0.3   # 'β': Scales the penalty for complexity (graph size).

        # --- Synthesis Trigger Thresholds ---
        # Paper Reference: Section 3.2, "Synthesis Trigger"
        # These thresholds act as a gatekeeper for the expensive synthesis process.
        # An SNO pair is only considered for synthesis if BOTH its Chirality and
        # Entanglement scores exceed these minimums. This is key to balancing
        # the cost of synthesis with the potential for discovery.
        self.synthesis_thresholds: Dict[str, float] = {
            'chirality': 0.7,
            'entanglement': 0.5
        }
        
        # --- Model Identifiers ---
        # These are the concrete HuggingFace model identifiers for the abstract
        # components described in the paper.
        self.models: Dict[str, str] = {
            # Used to compute the Hypothesis Embedding 'H' (Section 2.1)
            'embedding': "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
            # The Natural Language Inference model for the Grounding Critic (Section 2.2)
            'nli': "roberta-large-mnli",
            # The generative instruction-tuned model for the Synthesis Engine (Section 2.3)
            'synthesis': "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1"
        }

    def to_dict(self) -> Dict:
        """Convert configuration to a dictionary for easy serialization and logging."""
        return {
            'embedding_dim': self.embedding_dim,
            'critic_weights': self.critic_weights,
            'novelty_alpha': self.novelty_alpha,
            'novelty_beta': self.novelty_beta,
            'synthesis_thresholds': self.synthesis_thresholds,
            'models': self.models
        }
```

### Initializing the Environment

Finally, we create a global configuration instance to be used throughout the system.

```python
# Create a global configuration instance.
cns_config = CNSConfig()

print("\nCNS 2.0 Foundation Environment Ready")
print("Current Configuration:")
print(json.dumps(cns_config.to_dict(), indent=2))
```

This enhanced setup provides a more rigorous and clearly annotated foundation, preparing you for the advanced implementations in the chapters to come.
