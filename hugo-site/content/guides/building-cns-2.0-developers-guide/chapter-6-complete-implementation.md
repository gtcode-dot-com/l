# Chapter 6: Complete Implementation

## Bringing It All Together

This chapter builds upon the functional primitives from previous chapters to create a fully integrated, end-to-end system. We will complete the implementation with a realistic synthesis engine and, most importantly, provide clear guidelines for deploying the CNS 2.0 system in a production environment.

## Complete Synthesis Implementation

To make our implementation more realistic, we'll replace the hardcoded synthesis outputs with a `MockLLMClient`. This simulates the asynchronous nature of a real API call and makes the code structure identical to a production version, ready to be swapped with a real client like `OpenAI` or `Anthropic`.

### From Paper to Code: The Dialectical Prompt
(This section remains the same as the original file.)

## Deployment and Scaling for Production

A "complete" implementation isn't just about code; it's about making that code deployable and scalable. The `asyncio` based system we've built is excellent for a single-process application but needs a more robust architecture for production.

### 1. Containerization with Docker

Containerizing the CNS system using Docker provides a consistent, isolated, and portable environment, which is critical for deployment.

First, create a `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies:
```txt
# requirements.txt
numpy
networkx
torch
transformers
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu # or faiss-gpu
scikit-learn
matplotlib
# For a production job queue:
redis
celery
```

Next, create a `Dockerfile` to package the application:
```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY . .

# Command to run the application
# This would be the script that starts the CNSWorkflowManager or Celery workers
CMD [ "python", "./cns_main.py" ]
```
With this `Dockerfile`, you can build and run the CNS system anywhere Docker is installed, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.

### 2. Scaling with a Dedicated Job Queue

The in-memory `asyncio.PriorityQueue` is a major bottleneck for scaling. In a production environment with multiple workers, tasks need to be distributed via a centralized message broker. **Celery** with **Redis** is a standard, powerful solution for this.

The architecture would shift as follows:

1.  **API Server (e.g., FastAPI)**: A lightweight web server receives document submission requests. Instead of putting tasks into a local queue, it calls a Celery task.
2.  **Message Broker (Redis)**: Redis holds the queue of tasks to be processed.
3.  **Celery Workers (Multiple Containers)**: These are the workhorses. You can run multiple instances of the CNS application as Celery workers. Each worker pulls a task (e.g., "ingest this document") from the Redis queue and executes it.

Here’s how you might define an ingestion task using Celery:

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import Celery
from cns_workflow_manager import CNSWorkflowManager # Your main CNS logic

# Configure Celery
# The broker URL points to your Redis instance.
app = Celery('cns_tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

# Initialize a singleton instance of the CNS manager
# Models are loaded only once per worker, which is very efficient.
cns_manager = CNSWorkflowManager()

@app.task
def process_document_task(document_text: str, source_metadata: dict):
    """
    A Celery task to handle the ingestion of a single document.
    This function will be executed by a remote Celery worker.
    """
    # Note: The original manager used asyncio, so you would need to adapt
    # the core ingestion logic to be synchronous or use Celery's async support.
    # For simplicity, let's assume a synchronous version `ingest_document_sync`.
    
    # cns_manager.ingest_document_sync(document_text, source_metadata)
    
    logger.info(f"Finished processing document: {source_metadata.get('title')}")

```

To start a worker, you would run: `celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info`.

This architecture decouples the task submission from the actual processing, allowing you to scale the number of workers independently based on the workload, creating a truly robust and scalable production system.
