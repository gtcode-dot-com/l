# Chapter 6: Complete Implementation

## Bringing It All Together

This chapter builds upon the functional primitives from previous chapters to create a fully integrated, end-to-end system. We will complete the implementation with a realistic synthesis engine and, most importantly, provide clear guidelines for deploying the CNS 2.0 system in a production environment.

## Complete Synthesis Implementation

To make our implementation more realistic, we'll replace the hardcoded synthesis outputs with a `MockLLMClient`. This simulates the asynchronous nature of a real API call and makes the code structure identical to a production version, ready to be swapped with a real client like `OpenAI` or `Anthropic`.

### From Paper to Code: The Dialectical Prompt
(This section remains the same as the original file.)

## Deployment and Scaling for Production

A "complete" implementation isn't just about code; it's about making that code deployable, scalable, and observable. The `asyncio`-based system we've built is an excellent single-process application, but a production-grade system requires a more robust, distributed architecture. This section provides a step-by-step guide to productionizing the CNS 2.0 system.

### 1. Containerization with Docker

Containerizing the CNS system with Docker is the first step. It provides a consistent, isolated, and portable environment, which is critical for reliable deployment.

**Step 1: Create a `requirements.txt` file.**
This file lists all Python dependencies for your project.

```txt
# requirements.txt
numpy
networkx
torch
transformers
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu         # Use faiss-gpu if you have a compatible GPU
scikit-learn
matplotlib
PyYAML            # For loading config files from YAML

# For a production job queue
redis
celery

# For structured logging
structlog
```

**Step 2: Create a `Dockerfile`.**
This file is a blueprint for building your container image.

```dockerfile
# Start with an official Python slim image for a smaller footprint
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker's layer caching.
# Dependencies will only be re-installed if this file changes.
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container.
# This is done *after* installing dependencies, so code changes
# don't trigger a full dependency re-installation.
COPY . .

# Define the default command to run when the container starts.
# This will typically be the command to start a Celery worker.
CMD [ "celery", "-A", "cns.tasks", "worker", "--loglevel=info" ]
```

**Step 3: Build the Docker image.**
From your terminal, run the build command:
`docker build -t cns-worker:latest .`

With this image, you can now run the CNS system anywhere Docker is installed, eliminating "it works on my machine" problems.

### 2. Scaling with a Dedicated Job Queue (Celery)

The in-memory `asyncio.Queue` is a major bottleneck for scaling. A production environment with multiple workers requires a centralized **message broker** to distribute tasks. We will use **Celery** with **Redis**.

The architecture shifts as follows:
1.  **API Server (e.g., FastAPI)**: A lightweight web server receives requests (e.g., to ingest a new document). Instead of processing it directly, it enqueues a task in Celery.
2.  **Message Broker (Redis)**: Redis holds the queue of tasks to be processed. It is a fast, in-memory data store that is perfect for this role.
3.  **Celery Workers (Multiple Docker Containers)**: These are the workhorses. You can run multiple instances of your `cns-worker` container. Each worker pulls a task from the Redis queue and executes it.

**Step 1: Define Celery tasks.**
Create a `tasks.py` file. This is where you define the functions that your workers will execute.

```python
# cns/tasks.py
from celery import Celery
from .workflow import CNSWorkflowManager # Your main CNS logic
from .logging_setup import logger # Use our structured logger

# Configure Celery to use Redis as the message broker.
app = Celery('cns_tasks', broker='redis://redis:6379/0')

# Initialize a singleton instance of the CNS manager.
# Models are loaded only once per worker process, which is very efficient.
cns_manager = CNSWorkflowManager()

@app.task
def process_ingestion(document_text: str, source: str):
    """A Celery task to handle the ingestion of a single document."""
    logger.info("ingestion_task_received", source=source)
    # Note: The original manager used asyncio. For Celery, you would
    # adapt the core logic to be synchronous or use Celery's async support.
    # Here, we assume a synchronous `ingest_and_evaluate` method.
    cns_manager.ingest_and_evaluate(document_text, source)
    logger.info("ingestion_task_complete", source=source)
```

**Step 2: Start the services.**
You would typically use `docker-compose` to start Redis, the API server, and your Celery workers together. This architecture decouples task submission from processing, allowing you to scale the number of workers independently to handle any workload.

### 3. Production-Ready Logging with `structlog`

In a distributed system with multiple workers, standard print statements or basic logs are insufficient. You need **structured logging**. Structured logs (e.g., in JSON format) are machine-readable, making them easy to search, filter, and analyze in a centralized logging platform (like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Datadog).

**Step 1: Configure `structlog`.**
Create a `logging_setup.py` file to configure logging for your entire application.

```python
# cns/logging_setup.py
import logging
import structlog

# Configure standard logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Configure structlog
structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
    ],
    logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
    wrapper_class=structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger,
)

logger = structlog.get_logger()
```

**Step 2: Use the logger in your application.**
Instead of `print()` or `logging.info()`, use the `structlog` logger.

```python
# in cns/workflow.py
from .logging_setup import logger

class CNSWorkflowManager:
    def ingest_and_evaluate(self, text, source):
        logger.info("sno_ingestion_started", source=source, text_length=len(text))
        try:
            # ... ingestion logic ...
            sno = self.ingestion_pipeline.ingest_document(text, source)
            # ... evaluation logic ...
            self.critic_pipeline.evaluate_sno(sno, context)
            logger.info(
                "sno_evaluation_complete",
                sno_id=sno.sno_id,
                trust_score=sno.trust_score,
                source=source,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("ingestion_failed", error=str(e), source=source)

```

When this code runs, it will produce JSON log entries like this:
`{"log_level": "info", "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:30:00Z", "event": "sno_evaluation_complete", "sno_id": "...", "trust_score": 0.75, "source": "doc1.pdf"}`

This format is incredibly powerful for debugging and monitoring a complex, distributed system.

### 3. Production Configuration Management

In our guide, we've used a `CNSConfig` class with hardcoded values for simplicity. This is not suitable for a production environment where you need to change parameters without altering the code. The solution is to externalize the configuration.

#### Strategy 1: Environment Variables

A common practice is to read configuration from environment variables. This is highly portable and aligns with the principles of [12-factor apps](https://12factor.net/config).

You would modify the `CNSConfig` class to read from `os.environ`:

```python
import os
import json

class CNSConfig:
    def __init__(self):
        # Read from environment variable, falling back to a default value.
        self.embedding_dim = int(os.environ.get('CNS_EMBEDDING_DIM', 768))

        # For nested structures, we can expect a JSON string.
        default_weights = '{"grounding": 0.4, "logic": 0.3, "novelty": 0.3}'
        self.critic_weights = json.loads(os.environ.get('CNS_CRITIC_WEIGHTS', default_weights))

        # ... and so on for all other parameters.
```
When running in Docker, you can pass these environment variables using the `-e` flag:
`docker run -e CNS_CRITIC_WEIGHTS='{"grounding": 0.8, "logic": 0.1, "novelty": 0.1}' cns-app`

#### Strategy 2: Configuration File

For more complex configurations, a dedicated file is often easier to manage. Since we saw a `config.yaml` in the repository, let's use that.

First, create a `config.yaml`:
```yaml
# config.yaml
embedding_dim: 768

critic_weights:
  grounding: 0.4
  logic: 0.3
  novelty: 0.3

models:
  embedding: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  nli: "roberta-large-mnli"
```

Then, modify `CNSConfig` to load from this file:

```python
import yaml

class CNSConfig:
    def __init__(self, config_path="config.yaml"):
        with open(config_path, 'r') as f:
            config = yaml.safe_load(f)

        self.embedding_dim = config['embedding_dim']
        self.critic_weights = config['critic_weights']
        self.models = config['models']
        # ... and so on
```

This approach makes it easy to maintain multiple configuration profiles (e.g., `config_dev.yaml`, `config_prod.yaml`) and provides a clear, version-controllable record of the system's parameters.
