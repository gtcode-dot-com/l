# Chapter 6: Production Deployment and Scaling

## From Prototype to Production

In Chapter 5, we built a fully functional, single-process CNS system using `asyncio`. This is an excellent architecture for development, testing, and small-scale use. This chapter answers the critical next question: **"How do I run this as a robust, scalable, production-grade service?"**

Taking a prototype to production involves three key pillars, which will form the structure of this chapter:
1.  **Containerization**: Packaging our application into a portable and reproducible format using Docker.
2.  **Distributed Task Execution**: Replacing the single `asyncio` queue with a powerful, distributed job queue system (Celery with Redis) to enable horizontal scaling.
3.  **Production-Ready Observability**: Implementing structured logging and externalized configuration, which are essential for managing and monitoring a deployed application.

## The Production Architecture: From `asyncio` to `Celery`

The single-process `asyncio` model is limited by the resources (CPU, memory) of a single machine and cannot be easily scaled out. To handle a high volume of ingestion tasks and parallel syntheses, we must evolve to a distributed architecture.

Our target production architecture consists of three main components:
1.  **API Server (e.g., FastAPI or Flask)**: A lightweight web server that provides an entry point to the system. Instead of processing tasks itself, it simply adds them to a message broker.
2.  **Message Broker (Redis)**: A high-performance, in-memory message queue. It holds the "to-do list" of tasks for the entire system.
3.  **Celery Workers (Multiple Containers)**: These are the workhorses. Each worker is a container running our CNS application. They pull tasks from the Redis queue and execute them. You can run one, ten, or a hundred of these workers in parallel to meet any demand.

This architecture decouples task submission from task execution, allowing for massive scalability and resilience.

## 1. Containerization with Docker

Containerizing our application with Docker is the foundational step. It bundles our code, dependencies, and environment into a single, portable image, which is critical for reliable deployment and scaling.

**Step 1: Create a `requirements.txt` file.**
This file lists all Python dependencies needed to run the CNS system.

```txt
# requirements.txt
numpy
networkx
torch
transformers
sentence-transformers
faiss-cpu         # Use faiss-gpu if you have a compatible GPU
scikit-learn
matplotlib
PyYAML            # For loading config files from YAML

# For the production job queue
redis
celery

# For structured logging
structlog
```

**Step 2: Create a `Dockerfile`.**
This file is the blueprint for building our container image.

```dockerfile
# Start with an official Python slim image for a smaller footprint
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the requirements file first to leverage Docker's layer caching.
# Dependencies will only be re-installed if this file changes.
COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container.
# This is done *after* installing dependencies, so code changes
# don't trigger a full dependency re-installation.
COPY . .

# Define the default command to run when the container starts.
# This will typically be the command to start a Celery worker.
CMD [ "celery", "-A", "cns.tasks", "worker", "--loglevel=info" ]
```

With this image, built using `docker build -t cns-worker:latest .`, we can now run our CNS application consistently anywhere Docker is installed.

## 2. Distributed Task Execution with Celery and Redis

The in-memory `asyncio.Queue` from Chapter 5 is the component we need to replace to enable scaling. We will use **Celery**, a powerful distributed task queue, with **Redis** as its message broker.

**Step 1: Define Celery tasks.**
We create a `tasks.py` file. This is where the functions that our workers will execute are defined. Notice how a task is as simple as adding a `@app.task` decorator.

```python
# cns/tasks.py
from celery import Celery
from .workflow import CNSWorkflowManager # Your main CNS logic
from .logging_setup import logger # Use our structured logger

# Configure Celery to use Redis as the message broker.
# The hostname 'redis' will be resolved by Docker's internal networking.
app = Celery('cns_tasks', broker='redis://redis:6379/0')

# Initialize a singleton instance of the CNS manager.
# Models are loaded only once per worker process, which is very efficient.
cns_manager = CNSWorkflowManager()

@app.task
def process_ingestion(document_text: str, source: str):
    """A Celery task to handle the ingestion of a single document."""
    logger.info("ingestion_task_received", source=source)
    # Note: The original manager used asyncio. For Celery, you would
    # adapt the core logic to be synchronous or use Celery's async support.
    # Here, we assume a synchronous `ingest_and_evaluate` method.
    cns_manager.ingest_and_evaluate(document_text, source)
    logger.info("ingestion_task_complete", source=source)
```

**Step 2: Start the services.**
You would typically use `docker-compose` to start Redis, your API server, and your Celery workers together. Now, when your API server receives a request to ingest a document, it doesn't do the work itself. It simply calls `process_ingestion.delay(text, source)`, which places the task onto the Redis queue. Any available Celery worker can then pick up and execute the task. This allows you to scale the number of workers independently to handle any workload.

## 3. Production-Ready Observability

In a distributed system with multiple workers, observability is not a luxury; it's a necessity. We need robust logging and configuration to manage and debug our application effectively.

### Structured Logging with `structlog`

Standard print statements or basic logs are insufficient in a distributed system. **Structured logging** (e.g., in JSON format) is machine-readable, making it easy to search, filter, and analyze logs from all workers in a centralized platform (like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Datadog).

**Step 1: Configure `structlog`.**
Create a `logging_setup.py` file to configure logging for your entire application.

```python
# cns/logging_setup.py
import logging
import structlog

# Configure standard logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Configure structlog to output JSON
structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
    ],
    logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
    wrapper_class=structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger,
)

logger = structlog.get_logger()
```

**Step 2: Use the logger in your application.**
Instead of `print()` or `logging.info()`, use the configured `structlog` logger.

```python
# in cns/workflow.py
from .logging_setup import logger

class CNSWorkflowManager:
    def ingest_and_evaluate(self, text, source):
        logger.info("sno_ingestion.started", source=source, text_length=len(text))
        try:
            # ... ingestion and evaluation logic ...
            logger.info(
                "sno_evaluation.complete",
                sno_id=sno.sno_id,
                trust_score=sno.trust_score,
                source=source,
            )
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("ingestion.failed", error=str(e), source=source)
```

This produces clean, queryable JSON log entries, which are invaluable for debugging a complex, distributed system:
`{"log_level": "info", "timestamp": "...", "event": "sno_evaluation.complete", "sno_id": "...", "trust_score": 0.75, "source": "doc1.pdf"}`

### Externalized Configuration Management

Hardcoding values in a `CNSConfig` class is not suitable for production. The solution is to externalize the configuration, allowing you to change parameters without altering the code.

**Strategy 1: Environment Variables**
This is a highly portable method that aligns with [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/config) principles. You modify the `CNSConfig` class to read from `os.environ`.

```python
# In CNSConfig class
import os
import json

# Read from environment variable, falling back to a default value.
self.embedding_dim = int(os.environ.get('CNS_EMBEDDING_DIM', 768))

# For nested structures, we can expect a JSON string.
default_weights = '{"grounding": 0.4, "logic": 0.3, "novelty": 0.3}'
self.critic_weights = json.loads(os.environ.get('CNS_CRITIC_WEIGHTS', default_weights))
```

**Strategy 2: Configuration File**
For more complex configurations, a dedicated YAML file is often easier to manage.

```yaml
# config.yaml
embedding_dim: 768
critic_weights:
  grounding: 0.4
  logic: 0.3
  novelty: 0.3
models:
  embedding: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
  nli: "roberta-large-mnli"
```

Your `CNSConfig` class would then load this file using a library like `PyYAML`. This approach makes it easy to maintain multiple configuration profiles (e.g., `config_dev.yaml`, `config_prod.yaml`) and provides a clear, version-controllable record of the system's parameters.
