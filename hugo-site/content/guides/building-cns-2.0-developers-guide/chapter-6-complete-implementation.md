# Chapter 6: Complete Implementation

## Bringing It All Together

This chapter builds upon the functional critic and exploration primitives developed in Chapters 3 and 4 to create a fully integrated, end-to-end system. We've built the foundational components of CNS 2.0: Structured Narrative Objects, the Multi-Component Critic Pipeline, the Generative Synthesis Engine, and system integration framework. Now it's time to complete the implementation with full synthesis capabilities and prepare the system for production deployment.

This final chapter implements the complete synthesis workflow, advanced evaluation techniques, and provides guidelines for deploying a production-ready CNS 2.0 system.

### From Paper to Code: The Dialectical Prompt

Section 2.3 of the paper describes the core synthesis workflow and emphasizes the importance of structured prompts that preserve argumentative structure. The paper outlines a four-step process:

> **From the Paper (Section 2.3):**
> The synthesis workflow operates as follows:
> 1. **Chiral Pair Selection:** Identify SNO pairs $(\mathcal{S}_A, \mathcal{S}_B)$ with high chirality and evidential entanglement scores
> 2. **Dialectical Prompt Construction:** Transform SNOs into a structured prompt that preserves argumentative structure
> 3. **Candidate Generation:** The LLM produces a new SNO $\mathcal{S}_C = (H_C, G_C, \mathcal{E}_C, \varnothing)$ where $\mathcal{E}_C \supseteq \mathcal{E}_A \cap \mathcal{E}_B$
> 4. **Critic Evaluation:** The candidate $\mathcal{S}_C$ enters the critic pipeline to determine its viability

**From Paper to Code:**

Our `AdvancedSynthesisEngine` directly implements this workflow:

- **Step 1** is handled by our `ChiralPairDetector` from Chapter 4, which identifies high-potential pairs
- **Step 2** is implemented in our `_construct_synthesis_prompt` method, which transforms the SNO data structures into structured natural language prompts that preserve the hypothesis embeddings, reasoning graphs, and evidence sets
- **Step 3** is our `_generate_synthesis_hypothesis` method (simplified for demonstration), which would interface with an LLM to generate the new hypothesis
- **Step 4** is handled by passing the generated candidate through our `CriticPipeline` from Chapter 3

The paper's requirement that $\mathcal{E}_C \supseteq \mathcal{E}_A \cap \mathcal{E}_B$ (the synthesized evidence set must include at least the intersection of the source evidence sets) is directly implemented in our `_create_synthesized_sno` method:

```python
# Inherit and merge evidence sets
combined_evidence = chiral_pair.sno_a.evidence_set.union(chiral_pair.sno_b.evidence_set)
for evidence in combined_evidence:
    synthesized_sno.add_evidence(evidence)
```

This ensures that our synthesis preserves the evidential foundation from both source narratives, just as the mathematical specification requires.
