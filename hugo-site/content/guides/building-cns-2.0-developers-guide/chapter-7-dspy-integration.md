# Chapter 7: Advanced Optimization with DSPy

## From Prompt Engineering to Programmatic Optimization

Throughout this guide, we have successfully built a functional CNS 2.0 system based on the research paper's blueprint. Our `AdvancedSynthesisEngine` and `NarrativeIngestionPipeline` rely on carefully hand-crafted prompts to instruct Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach, known as "prompt engineering," has several critical weaknesses in a production system:

-   **Brittleness:** Prompts that work well for one model (e.g., GPT-4) may perform poorly or fail entirely on another (e.g., Llama 3) or even on a future version of the same model.
-   **Poor Composability:** Chaining multiple prompt-driven steps together is complex, and errors in one step can cascade unpredictably.
-   **Difficult Optimization:** Improving the system requires a manual, trial-and-error process of tweaking prompts, which is inefficient and not scalable.

To elevate our CNS 2.0 implementation from a prototype to a robust, self-optimizing system, we need to move from *prompting* to *programming*. This is where **DSPy** comes in.

## Introducing DSPy: A Framework for Programming LLMs

DSPy is a framework from Stanford NLP that provides a systematic way to build and optimize complex systems that use LLMs. It asks us to define the *logic* of our program (the steps it should take) and the *metric* we want to maximize, and it then automatically finds the best prompts, few-shot examples, and even model weights to achieve that goal.

The core components of DSPy are:

1.  **Signatures:** These are declarative specifications that define the input and output fields for an LLM task (e.g., `document -> summary, claims`).
2.  **Modules:** These are the building blocks of a DSPy program, like `dspy.ChainOfThought` or `dspy.Predict`, which use signatures to call LLMs.
3.  **Optimizers (Compilers):** These are algorithms that tune the modules (by generating effective prompts and few-shot examples) to maximize a given performance metric on your data.

### From Paper to Code: Tackling the Research Challenge

The CNS 2.0 paper explicitly identifies the **Narrative Ingestion Pipeline** as a "major research challenge" (Section 3.1). Our heuristic-based implementation in Chapter 5 was a functional placeholder. DSPy provides the exact framework needed to tackle this research challenge head-on.

Instead of manually trying to find the perfect prompt to extract a hypothesis and claims from a document, we can define what a "good" extraction looks like with a metric and let a DSPy optimizer do the hard work for us.

Let's refactor our `NarrativeIngestionPipeline` to use DSPy.

## Refactoring Ingestion with DSPy

Our goal is to replace the fragile heuristic-based methods (`_extract_central_hypothesis`, `_construct_reasoning_graph`) with a single, optimizable DSPy module.

from typing import List

# --- 1. Configure DSPy ---
# This sets up the language model we'll use.
# You would replace this with your actual model provider (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or a local model).
turbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-1106', max_tokens=4000)
dspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)

# --- 2. Define Structured Output with Pydantic ---
# We define the structure of a single extracted claim. This ensures the LLM
# returns data in a clean, predictable format.
class ExtractedClaim(BaseModel):
    claim_id: str = Field(description="A unique identifier for the claim, e.g., 'claim_1'")
    content: str = Field(description="The text content of the claim.")
    claim_type: str = Field(description="The type of claim, e.g., 'premise', 'conclusion'.")
    relationships: List[str] = Field(description="List of claim_ids this claim supports or contradicts.")

# --- 3. Define the DSPy Signature ---
# The signature is the most important part. It tells DSPy what transformation
# we want the LLM to perform: from an unstructured document to a structured
# set of claims and a central hypothesis.
class DocumentToSNO(dspy.Signature):
    """

    claims: List[ExtractedClaim] = dspy.OutputField(desc="A structured list of key claims and their relationships from the document.")

# --- 4. Create the DSPy Module ---
# This module implements the logic of our program. We use ChainOfThought to
# encourage the LLM to "think step-by-step" before producing the final structured output.
class SNOIngestionModule(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.generate_structure = dspy.ChainOfThought(DocumentToSNO)

    def forward(self, document_text):
        return self.generate_structure(document_text=document_text)

# --- 5. Create Training Data and an Evaluation Metric ---
# To optimize our module, DSPy needs a few examples of "good" inputs and outputs,
# and a metric to measure performance.
def validate_sno_structure(example, pred, trace=None):
    """A simple metric to check if the prediction is valid."""
    try:
        # Check if the hypothesis is a non-empty string
        is_hypothesis_valid = isinstance(pred.central_hypothesis, str) and len(pred.central_hypothesis) > 10
        # Check if claims is a list and contains our Pydantic model

        if is_hypothesis_valid and is_claims_valid:
            return 1.0 # Success
        return 0.0 # Failure
    except Exception:
        return 0.0 # Failure if any parsing error occurs

# Create a few training examples. In a real project, you'd have dozens or hundreds.
train_examples = [
    dspy.Example(
        document_text="Our research demonstrates that solar panels are becoming more efficient. This is primarily due to advances in perovskite materials. Consequently, we project a 50% reduction in cost per watt by 2030.",
        central_hypothesis="Advances in perovskite materials are significantly increasing solar panel efficiency and will drive down costs.",
        claims=[
            ExtractedClaim(claim_id="claim_1", content="Solar panels are becoming more efficient.", claim_type="conclusion", relationships=["claim_2"]),
            ExtractedClaim(claim_id="claim_2", content="This efficiency is due to advances in perovskite materials.", claim_type="premise", relationships=[]),
        ]
    ).with_inputs('document_text'),
    # Add one or two more examples here for better optimization
]

# --- 6. Optimize (Compile) the Module ---
# This is the magic of DSPy. The BootstrapFewShot optimizer will generate prompts
# and few-shot examples from our training data and find the combination that
# performs best according to our metric.
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShot

# Set up the optimizer
optimizer = BootstrapFewShot(metric=validate_sno_structure, max_bootstrapped_demos=2)

# Compile the module. This runs the optimization process.
optimized_ingestion_module = optimizer.compile(SNOIngestionModule(), trainset=train_examples)

# --- 7. Use the Optimized Module ---
# Now we can use our optimized module to process a new document.
new_document = "A study has shown that regular exercise improves cognitive function. The mechanism involves increased blood flow to the brain, which supports neural health. Therefore, public health policies should promote physical activity."

prediction = optimized_ingestion_module(new_document)

print(f"Central Hypothesis: {prediction.central_hypothesis}\n")
for claim in prediction.claims:
    print(f"Claim ({claim.claim_id}): {claim.content}")
    print(f"  - Type: {claim.claim_type}")
    print(f"  - Supports: {claim.relationships}")

```

## Integrating the DSPy Module into CNS 2.0

With our new `optimized_ingestion_module`, we can now dramatically simplify and improve our `NarrativeIngestionPipeline` from Chapter 5.

**The old pipeline:**
- Called `_extract_central_hypothesis` (heuristics).
- Called `_construct_reasoning_graph` (heuristics).
- Manually built an SNO from the messy results.

**The new DSPy-powered pipeline:**
1.  Initialize and load the compiled `optimized_ingestion_module` once.
2.  In the `ingest_document` method, make a single call: `prediction = self.ingestion_module(document_text)`.
3.  The `prediction` object will contain a clean, structured `central_hypothesis` and a list of `claims` that can be directly used to instantiate a `StructuredNarrativeObject` and build its reasoning graph.

This approach is not only cleaner and more reliable but is now **optimizable**. If we find our ingestion is performing poorly on certain types of documents, we simply add more examples to our training set and re-compile the module. The system improves without us having to guess at new prompts.

## Conclusion

By integrating DSPy, we have transformed the most fragile part of our CNS 2.0 system into its most robust and adaptable. We've moved beyond the static, brittle world of hand-crafted prompts and into a dynamic paradigm of programmatic, metric-driven optimization.

This same methodology can be applied to other components, particularly the `AdvancedSynthesisEngine`. A DSPy signature can be created to enforce the generation of a synthesized SNO, and the system's own critic pipeline can serve as the metric for optimization. This completes the vision of the research paper: a truly self-improving system that learns to get better at synthesizing knowledge over time.
