A theoretical blueprint, however detailed, is insufficient for scientific validation. Progress requires concrete experiments designed to rigorously test the core hypotheses of a new framework. This section documents the ongoing experimental work to test and validate the Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) 2.0 framework, beginning with a foundational Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE).

Our research in this area is organized into a series of case studies that move from controlled, historical examples to complex, real-world problems.

### Case Study 1: Synthesizing the Plate Tectonics vs. Geosyncline Debate (MVE)

This foundational experiment serves as a proof-of-concept for the core Dialectical Synthesis Engine, demonstrating its ability to resolve a historical scientific conflict and generate a result that aligns with modern consensus.

### Case Study 2 (In Progress): A Systematic Review of Conflicting [Modern Topic]

This ongoing research applies the CNS framework to a current, unresolved scientific or geopolitical issue, documenting the process of SNO creation and conflict analysis in a real-world, high-stakes domain.
