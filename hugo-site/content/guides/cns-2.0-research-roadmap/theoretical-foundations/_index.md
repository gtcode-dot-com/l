# Background & Context: The Theoretical Foundations of CNS 2.0

Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) 2.0 is not built in a vacuum. It stands on the shoulders of giants, integrating decades of research from computer science, formal logic, and even philosophy. Understanding these foundations reveals why CNS is designed the way it is and strengthens its credibility as a robust framework for knowledge synthesis.

This section provides a web-friendly summary of the key academic fields that inform the CNS 2.0 architecture, acting as a high-level overview of the project's foundational bibliography.

## 1. Argumentation & Dialectics

At its heart, CNS is a system that reasons about arguments. The fields of **Argumentation Mining** and **Computational Dialectics** provide the formalisms to make this possible.

-   **What it is:** Argumentation Mining is the automated task of extracting arguments from textâ€”identifying claims, premises, and the relationships between them. Computational Dialectics provides formal rules and protocols for how rational agents should conduct a debate or resolve a dispute.
-   **How it informs CNS:**
    -   The **Reasoning Graph** inside each Structured Narrative Object (SNO) is a direct application of argumentation theory, capturing the logical structure of a narrative in a machine-readable format.
    -   The **Generative Synthesis Engine** doesn't just summarize text; it engages in a structured *dialectical* process. It uses principles from computational dialectics to guide the LLM in resolving specific points of conflict between two opposing narratives, leading to a more coherent and logical synthesis.

## 2. Knowledge Graphs & Logic

Narratives and arguments must be connected to facts about the world. This is where research in **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)** becomes essential.

-   **What it is:** KGs are large networks of interconnected facts. KG Fusion and Conflict Resolution are techniques for combining information from multiple KGs and resolving contradictions that arise.
-   **How it informs CNS:**
    -   The **Evidence Set** in an SNO is more than just a list of links; it's a set of pointers to a verifiable knowledge base, which can be represented as a KG. This ensures that all arguments are grounded in real-world data.
    -   The **Logic Critic** and the concept of **Evidential Entanglement** rely heavily on KG principles. When two narratives conflict, the system can check their evidence against the KG to identify the precise points of factual disagreement. KG conflict resolution techniques provide formal methods for handling these discrepancies.

## 3. Epistemology & Belief Revision

CNS aims to produce *knowledge*, not just information. This goal is deeply informed by the philosophical field of **Epistemology**, which studies the nature of knowledge, justification, and belief.

-   **What it is:** Epistemology asks questions like, "What does it mean to know something?" and "What makes a belief justified?" A related field, **Belief Revision**, provides formal models for how a rational agent should change its beliefs when it encounters new or contradictory information.
-   **How it informs CNS:**
    -   The **Trust Score** is a computational proxy for the philosophical concept of "justification" or "warrant." It's a calculated measure of how much confidence we should have in a narrative, based on its evidence and logical soundness.
    -   The entire CNS operational loop is an exercise in belief revision. The system maintains a population of trusted narratives (a "belief state") and uses the synthesis engine to rationally update that state when it encounters compelling, conflicting information. This ensures that the system's knowledge is not static but evolves in a principled and logical way.

By integrating these diverse fields, CNS 2.0 creates a framework that is not only computationally powerful but also grounded in a rich intellectual tradition of logic, argumentation, and epistemology.
