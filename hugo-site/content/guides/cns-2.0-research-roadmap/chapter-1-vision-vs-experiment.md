## CNS 2.0 System Architecture

The complete CNS 2.0 architecture encompasses four integrated subsystems: automated narrative ingestion with argumentation mining capabilities, GNN-based logical validation through multi-component critic pipelines, autonomous multi-agent synthesis environments, and self-optimizing DSPy-driven prompt evolution. Each subsystem implements specific mathematical frameworks—the ingestion pipeline employs transformer-based embedding models for semantic extraction, the critic system utilizes graph neural networks for logical relationship validation, the synthesis engine operates through dialectical pair selection using chirality scores and evidential entanglement metrics, and the optimization layer leverages programmatic prompt compilation with graded evaluation metrics.

## Experimental Design Constraints and Variable Isolation

Simultaneous validation of all four subsystems violates fundamental experimental design principles by introducing uncontrolled confounding variables that preclude causal attribution. The experimental challenge manifests across three dimensions: component interaction effects (synthesis performance degradation could originate from ingestion pipeline errors, critic system miscalibration, or synthesis algorithm deficiencies), model dependency confounds (novel synthesis methodology effectiveness becomes conflated with underlying LLM capabilities), and statistical power dilution (multiple simultaneous hypotheses reduce effect size detectability and inflate Type II error rates).

Rigorous experimental methodology demands single-component isolation with controlled input conditions to establish clear causal relationships between intervention and outcome variables.

## Minimum Viable Experiment: Dialectical Synthesis Engine

The Dialectical Synthesis Engine represents the optimal experimental target based on three criteria: theoretical novelty (dialectical reasoning for knowledge synthesis constitutes a novel contribution to automated reasoning literature), measurable outcomes (synthesis quality admits quantitative evaluation through multiple validated metrics), and implementation feasibility (engine operation requires only controlled SNO inputs, eliminating upstream system dependencies).

The engine's core hypothesis posits that structured dialectical reasoning—operationalized through chirality score maximization and evidential entanglement optimization—generates higher-order syntheses that demonstrate superior logical coherence, factual accuracy, and novel insight generation compared to baseline approaches including vector averaging, extractive summarization, and simple concatenation methods.

## Statistical Validation Framework Integration

Experimental validation implements the standard Experimental Validation Protocol with the following specifications:

**Sample Size Calculation**: To ensure our experiment can reliably detect a meaningful improvement, we first perform a power analysis. Targeting a large effect size (Cohen's d = 0.8) with standard significance (α = 0.05) and power (80%, or β = 0.20) levels, we determined that a minimum of n ≥ 26 synthesis pairs are required per experimental condition. A more conservative estimate of n = 35 pairs per condition was chosen to account for any potential data issues.

**Statistical Measures**: To quantify our findings, we will use several key statistical measures. Primary outcomes include synthesis quality scores, logical coherence ratings, and counts of novel insights. To understand the magnitude of our findings, effect sizes will be reported with 95% confidence intervals (giving a range of plausible values for the true effect). Standard significance testing will be used to determine the probability that our results are not due to random chance.

**Implementation Alignment**: The experimental design directly leverages the ChiralPairDetector and RelationalMetrics components detailed in the developer guide Chapter 4, ensuring seamless translation from research validation to production deployment. The DSPy optimization framework from Chapter 7 provides the programmatic infrastructure for systematic prompt refinement and performance optimization.

This experimental framework establishes the foundation for statistically rigorous validation while maintaining direct alignment with the production system architecture, ensuring research findings translate directly to implementation capabilities.
