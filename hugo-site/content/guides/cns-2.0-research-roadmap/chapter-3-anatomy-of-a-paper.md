A successful experiment is only half the battle in research. The other half is communicating the findings effectively to the scientific community. To do this, we will structure our results into a high-quality academic paper following the standard **IMRaD** format (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion).

This structure ensures that our work is presented logically, is easy for other researchers to understand and evaluate, and meets the standards for publication in reputable journals and conferences.

Here is how the Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE) detailed in Chapter 2 maps directly onto the IMRaD structure:

### Introduction

*   **Problem Motivation:** We will begin by motivating the critical challenge of automated knowledge synthesis in an age of information overload. We will highlight the limitations of existing methods (e.g., summarization, simple aggregation) which often fail to resolve deep-seated conflicts in source material.
*   **Our Contribution:** We will clearly state our primary contribution: the design and empirical validation of a novel **Dialectical Synthesis Engine**. We will posit that this engine is capable of producing higher-order, coherent syntheses from conflicting narrative inputs.
*   **Roadmap:** The introduction will conclude with a brief outline of the paper's structure.

### Methods

This section will provide a detailed, reproducible account of our experimental setup. Transparency and clarity are paramount here.
*   **The SNO Data Structure:** We will briefly define the Structured Narrative Object (SNO) as our fundamental unit of knowledge representation.
*   **The Synthesis Engine:** We will detail the algorithm of the synthesis engine, including the specific dialectical prompt template used to instruct the LLM.
*   **Experimental Setup (The Case Study):** We will describe our chosen case study (plate tectonics vs. geosyncline theory) and justify its selection. We will also be transparent about the **manual creation** of the parent SNOs, framing it as a necessary step to isolate the variable being tested (the engine's performance).
*   **Evaluation Protocol:** We will describe the quantitative and qualitative metrics used to evaluate the output, as detailed in Chapter 2.

### Results

This is the core of the paper, where we present the evidence.
*   **Quantitative Findings:** We will present the table of scores (`Trust Score`, `Grounding Score`, etc.) generated by our `CriticPipeline`.
*   **Qualitative Analysis:** This will be the most significant part of the section. We will present the generated hypothesis from `SNO_Synthesis` and, through direct textual comparison, demonstrate its alignment with the modern scientific understanding of plate tectonics. We will show, with examples, how it successfully resolved the core conflicts of the parent narratives.

### Discussion

In this final section, we will interpret our findings and situate them within the broader field.
*   **Interpretation of Results:** We will argue that the results from the MVE serve as a successful proof-of-concept for the viability of dialectical synthesis.
*   **Limitations:** Academic honesty is crucial. We will explicitly discuss the limitations of our study, with the most significant being the reliance on manually created SNOs. Other limitations might include the use of a single case study and the heuristic nature of our current critic pipeline.
*   **Future Work:** We will frame these limitations as clear avenues for future research, setting the stage for the work described in the final chapter of this roadmap. We will position this paper as the foundational step in the larger CNS 2.0 research program.

### Strengthening the Paper: Related Work

A thorough **Related Work** section will be included (typically after the Introduction) to properly contextualize our contribution. We will survey and cite existing research in relevant areas such as argumentation mining, multi-agent debate systems, automated summarization, and knowledge graph generation, clearly articulating what differentiates our dialectical synthesis approach from prior art.
