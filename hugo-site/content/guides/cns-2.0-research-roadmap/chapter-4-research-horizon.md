The successful completion of our Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE) and its publication will serve as a foundational, proof-of-concept milestone for the CNS 2.0 project. It is, however, just the first step. The limitations acknowledged in our first paper directly inform the next stages of our research agenda.

Our long-term goal is to progressively build and validate the components of the full CNS 2.0 "Grand Vision," with each major component representing a potential future publication.

### Future Paper #1: The Narrative Ingestion Pipeline

The most immediate limitation of our first study is the manual creation of parent SNOs. Our next research project will be to address this head-on by developing a robust, semi-automated **Narrative Ingestion Pipeline**.

-   **The Challenge:** The task is to move from unstructured text (e.g., a PDF of a scientific paper) to a structured SNO, correctly identifying the central hypothesis, extracting the reasoning graph, and linking claims to evidence.
-   **Proposed Methodology:** We plan to leverage modern Large Language Model (LLM) compilation frameworks like **[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy)**. Instead of relying on brittle, hand-crafted prompts, we will define the program's flow (e.g., `extract_hypothesis -> identify_claims -> build_graph`) and use DSPy to programmatically generate and optimize the complex prompts required for each step.
-   **Contribution:** This would represent a significant contribution to the fields of information extraction and argumentation mining.

### Future Paper #2: The GNN-based Logic Critic

Our current `CriticPipeline` relies on heuristics, which are transparent but limited in their logical depth. The next major step is to replace the heuristic logic critic with a more powerful, data-driven model.

-   **The Challenge:** Evaluating the logical coherence of a reasoning graph is a complex task. A more sophisticated critic is needed to detect subtle fallacies, enthymemes (unstated assumptions), and complex logical relationships.
-   **Proposed Methodology:** We envision a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** based model. This would involve:
    1.  **Dataset Creation:** Creating a large dataset of reasoning graphs labeled for logical soundness (a significant research contribution in itself).
    2.  **Model Training:** Training a GNN to learn the structural properties of valid (and invalid) reasoning.
-   **Contribution:** A successful GNN-based logic critic would be a powerful tool for automated reasoning and a significant advance over our initial heuristic models.

### Future Paper #3: Scalability and System Dynamics

With a robust ingestion pipeline and a powerful critic, we can finally begin to approach the "Grand Vision": running the full, autonomous CNS 2.0 system at scale.
-   **The Challenge:** How does a population of hundreds or thousands of SNOs interact? What are the emergent properties of the system? Does it converge on consensus, maintain stable polarized clusters, or generate novel insights at a systemic level?
-   **Proposed Methodology:** This research will move into the realm of complex systems analysis and simulation. We will deploy the full system architecture (as described in the **[Developer's Guide](/guides/building-cns-2.0-developers-guide/chapter-6-production-deployment/)**) and study its long-term dynamics.
-   **Contribution:** This work would provide insights into the fundamental dynamics of knowledge ecosystems and could have implications for understanding how scientific or social consensus forms.
