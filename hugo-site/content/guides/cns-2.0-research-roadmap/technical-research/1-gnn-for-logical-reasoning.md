### The Challenge: Beyond Heuristics

The heuristic-based `LogicCritic` developed in the foundational phase is transparent and effective for well-structured arguments. However, it has significant limitations. It relies on a predefined set of rules and cannot easily detect more subtle or novel forms of logical fallacies, nor can it learn from new data. To truly assess the complex reasoning graphs that will be generated at scale, we need a more powerful, data-driven approach.

### The Vision: A Self-Learning Logic Critic

This research project aims to replace the heuristic logic critic with a sophisticated **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** model. A GNN is the ideal architecture for this task because it is specifically designed to learn from graph-structured data. The GNN-based critic will learn to identify the subtle structural properties that differentiate a coherent, logical argument from a fallacious one.

### Key Research Questions

1.  Can a GNN model be trained to effectively classify reasoning graphs as logically sound or fallacious?
2.  What graph representations and GNN architectures are best suited for capturing complex logical relationships?
3.  How can we create a large-scale, high-quality dataset of labeled reasoning graphs for training and evaluation?

### Proposed Methodology

This project will be conducted in three main stages:

**Stage 1: Dataset Creation**
This is a significant research contribution in its own right. We will develop a semi-automated pipeline to create a large dataset of reasoning graphs, labeled for logical soundness.
-   **Source Material:** We will use a combination of sources, including philosophical texts on logic, legal arguments, and manually annotated scientific debates.
-   **Synthetic Data Generation:** We will also create synthetic data by programmatically generating valid argument structures and then applying "fallacy transformations" to create negative examples.
-   **Human-in-the-Loop:** All automatically generated graphs will be validated by human annotators with expertise in logic and argumentation theory.

**Stage 2: Model Development and Training**
-   We will experiment with various GNN architectures (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT) to find the most effective model for this task.
-   We will explore different feature engineering approaches, such as using node embeddings for claims and typed edges for logical relationships (e.g., "supports," "contradicts").
-   The model will be trained on the newly created dataset to predict a multi-faceted logic score, potentially identifying the specific type of fallacy detected.

**Stage 3: Evaluation and Integration**
-   The trained GNN critic will be evaluated on a held-out test set of reasoning graphs.
-   We will perform a detailed error analysis to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses.
-   Finally, the validated GNN model will be integrated back into the main CNS 2.0 `CriticPipeline`, replacing the original heuristic component.

### Expected Contribution

A successful GNN-based logic critic would be a state-of-the-art tool for automated reasoning. It would represent a significant advance over existing methods and would be a major step towards creating an AI system that can genuinely understand and evaluate the logical structure of arguments.
