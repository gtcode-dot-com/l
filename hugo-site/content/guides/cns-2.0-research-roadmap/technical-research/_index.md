With the foundational components in place, our research can turn to the truly cutting-edge technical challenges required to make CNS 2.0 a robust, scalable, and deeply intelligent system. This phase of the research program moves beyond the initial implementation to tackle next-generation problems in automated reasoning, privacy-preserving AI, and causal inference.

The projects in this section represent significant, multi-year research efforts. Each is a potential dissertation topic or a major research grant proposal. They are designed to produce not just incremental improvements, but fundamental breakthroughs in how AI systems handle logic, collaboration, and causality.

This section details three core advanced research thrusts:

1.  **[Graph Neural Networks for Logical Reasoning](./1-gnn-for-logical-reasoning/)**: Moving beyond heuristic-based logic critics to develop sophisticated, data-driven models capable of learning the deep structure of valid argumentation.

2.  **[Federated Learning and Privacy](./2-federated-learning-and-privacy/)**: Designing a CNS 2.0 architecture that can operate in a decentralized manner, allowing multiple organizations to collaborate on knowledge synthesis without sharing sensitive, proprietary source data.

3.  **[Formal Methods and Causal Inference](./3-formal-methods-and-causal-inference/)**: Integrating rigorous logical systems and causal reasoning frameworks to elevate the system's output from plausible narratives to logically sound and causally aware insights.

These research directions are essential for realizing the full potential of the CNS 2.0 vision. They aim to solve the core technical limitations of current systems and pave the way for a new generation of automated knowledge discovery tools.
