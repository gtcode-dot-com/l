Building a technically sophisticated system is only the first step. To make a genuine scientific contribution, we must rigorously and transparently evaluate its performance, understand its limitations, and assess its real-world utility. This research thrust is dedicated to the comprehensive validation of the CNS 2.0 framework.

The goal of this research is to move beyond "it works" to answer more critical questions:
-   How well does it work across different domains and over long periods?
-   How robust is it against errors, noise, and even malicious attacks?
-   How can it be best designed to augment human intelligence and collaborate effectively with human users?

This section details three core research projects aimed at answering these questions:

1.  **[Longitudinal and Cross-Domain Studies](./1-longitudinal-and-cross-domain-studies/)**: Assessing the system's long-term performance and its ability to generalize to new, unseen domains.

2.  **[Adversarial Robustness and Security](./2-adversarial-robustness-and-security/)**: Proactively testing the system's defenses against a range of attacks, from subtle evidence manipulation to coordinated disinformation campaigns.

3.  **[Human-AI Collaboration](./3-human-ai-collaboration/)**: Moving beyond system performance to study the human-computer interface, with the goal of designing a system that is a true cognitive partner for its users.

This evaluation program is just as critical as the core technical development. It ensures that we are not just building a powerful tool, but a reliable, safe, and genuinely useful one.
