Welcome to the Research Roadmap for the Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) 2.0 project. This section outlines our plan for rigorous, academic validation of the CNS 2.0 framework.

> **A Note on Scope:** This guide is focused on the **scientific validation plan** for the CNS 2.0 project. For a detailed, hands-on guide to the practical implementation of the system in Python, please see our complementary guide: **[Building CNS 2.0: A Developer's Guide](/guides/building-cns-2.0-developers-guide/)**.

The CNS 2.0 vision is ambitious, proposing a novel architecture for automated knowledge synthesis. However, a vision, a blueprint, or a working implementation is not, in itself, a scientifically validated result. The goal of academic research is to produce new knowledge that is robust, defensible, and has been subjected to peer review.

The purpose of this roadmap is to transparently outline the specific, focused experiment we are undertaking to produce the first peer-reviewed paper for the CNS project. This process requires moving from the broad, multi-component architectural design to a narrow, provable **"Minimum Viable Experiment" (MVE)**. The MVE is designed to isolate the core novel claim of our work and test it under controlled, reproducible conditions.

This guide details our methodology for this crucial step. Over the following chapters, we will cover:

1.  **[From Grand Vision to Focused Experiment](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-1-vision-vs-experiment/)**: How we narrow the scope from the entire CNS system to a single, testable hypothesis.
2.  **[The Minimum Viable Experiment (MVE)](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-2-minimum-viable-experiment/)**: The precise experimental design, including the case study, methodology, and evaluation protocol.
3.  **[The Anatomy of a Research Paper](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-3-anatomy-of-a-paper/)**: How the results of our MVE will be structured into a standard, high-impact academic paper.
4.  **[The Research Horizon](/guides/cns-2.0-research-roadmap/chapter-4-research-horizon/)**: Our long-term vision for future publications that will build upon this foundational work.

We are committed to conducting this research with transparency and rigor. We invite researchers, graduate students, and potential collaborators to follow our progress, scrutinize our methodology, and engage with us as we work to make a lasting contribution to the field.
