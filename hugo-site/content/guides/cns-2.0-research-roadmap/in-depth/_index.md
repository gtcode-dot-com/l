Welcome to the In-Depth section of the CNS 2.0 documentation.

While other sections of the **[Guides](/guides/)** provide tutorials and high-level roadmaps, this section is dedicated to deep dives into the specific, advanced concepts that form the theoretical and technical backbone of our project. These articles are adapted from the most detailed sections of our foundational **[Ideas Paper](./ideas-paper/)** and are intended for researchers and practitioners who wish to gain a more profound understanding of how CNS 2.0 works under the hood.

Here, we will explore topics such as:
-   The formal structure of our dialectical reasoning templates.
-   The mathematical foundations of our critic pipeline.
-   The theoretical underpinnings of our approach to evidence verification and trust.

We believe that transparency and a commitment to first principles are essential for building trustworthy AI. This section is a core part of that commitment.

### Articles in this Section

-   **[Dialectical Reasoning Templates](./dialectical-reasoning-templates/)**: A deep dive into the structured reasoning templates used by the CNS 2.0 synthesis engine to ensure logical consistency and mitigate hallucination.
