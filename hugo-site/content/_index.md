*Independent investigative reporting from Hawaii*

## Forthcoming Investigation

### Years of Research. Ready for Publication.

Oahu Underground is preparing to publish an investigative series grounded in **more than two decades of documentation** — public records, court filings, first-person accounts, and institutional patterns that have not previously been reported as a connected record.

> "The story isn't one person or one agency. It's a system — and the paper trail is extensive."

## Our Mission

### Independent Investigative Journalism for Hawaii

Oahu Underground exists for one reason: to hold power accountable in Hawaii. We are an independent, Hawaii-based investigative newsroom — no corporate owners, no political affiliations, no editorial interference.

Our forthcoming reporting draws on years of ground-level research into institutional corruption, judicial conduct, and the mechanisms that shield misconduct from public view. All claims will be sourced to documentation. All sources will be protected.

## Forthcoming Investigations

### I. Judicial Accountability & Bench Conduct

A documented examination of how certain Hawaii courts have operated outside the bounds of procedural law — and what happens when oversight mechanisms fail.

*Status: In Research*

### II. Institutional Capture & Public Trust

When the agencies meant to protect citizens become instruments of the interests they regulate, public trust is the first casualty. This series examines the structural incentives.

*Status: In Research*

### III. The Public Records Question

Hawaii's transparency laws exist on paper. In practice, obstruction, delay, and selective disclosure have become the norm. This investigation maps the distance between statute and practice.

*Status: In Research*
