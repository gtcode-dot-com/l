*Independent investigative reporting from Hawaii*

## Investigation Published

### Years of Research. Now Public.

Oahu Underground has published an investigative series grounded in **more than two decades of documentation** — public records, court filings, first-person accounts, and institutional patterns that have not previously been reported as a connected record.

> "The story isn't one person or one agency. It's a system — and the paper trail is extensive."

## Our Mission

### Independent Investigative Journalism for Hawaii

Oahu Underground exists for one reason: to hold power accountable in Hawaii. We are an independent, Hawaii-based investigative newsroom — no corporate owners, no political affiliations, no editorial interference.

Our reporting draws on years of ground-level research into institutional corruption, judicial conduct, and the mechanisms that shield misconduct from public view. All claims are sourced to documentation. All sources are protected.

## Investigations

### I. Judicial Accountability & Bench Conduct

A documented examination of how certain Hawaii courts have operated outside the bounds of procedural law — and what happens when oversight mechanisms fail.

### II. Institutional Capture & Public Trust

When the agencies meant to protect citizens become instruments of the interests they regulate, public trust is the first casualty. This series examines the structural incentives.

### III. The Public Records Question

Sealed cases, the 90-day loophole, police reports that went nowhere, and a Commission that stopped asking questions. This investigation maps the distance between statute and practice.
