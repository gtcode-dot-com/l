### Architecture components

The components of the solution architecture include:

* **Quick Suite components:**
  + **Spaces**
    for contract management workflows
  + **Chat agents**
    for conversational contract interactions
  + **Knowledge bases**
    for integrating legal documents stored in Amazon S3
  + **Topics**
    for integrating structured contract data
  + **Actions**
    for connecting to custom agents developed with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
  + **Flows**
    for recurring semi-manual document review processes
  + **Automate**
    for daily and monthly contract automation tasks
* **Multi-agent system powered by AgentCore:**
  + **Contract collaboration agent**
    : Central orchestrator coordinating workflow
  + **Legal agent**
    : Analyzes legal terms and extracts key obligations
  + **Risk agent**
    : Assesses financial and operational risks
  + **Compliance agent**
    : Evaluates regulatory compliance
* **Supporting infrastructure:**

## Contract management workflow

The solution implements a streamlined contract management workflow that significantly reduces processing time while improving accuracy. The system processes contracts through coordinated AI agents, typically completing analysis within minutes compared to days of manual review.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent type** | **Primary function** | **Key outputs** |
| Contract collaboration agent | Central orchestrator and workflow manager | Document routing decisions, and consolidated results |
| Legal agent | Legal term analysis and obligation extraction | Party details, key terms, obligations, and risk flags |
| Risk agent | Financial and operational risk assessment | Risk scores, exposure metrics, and negotiation recommendations |
| Compliance agent | Regulatory compliance evaluation | Compliance status, regulatory flags, and remediation suggestions |

Let’s explore an example of processing a sample service agreement contract. The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. The
   **contract collaboration agent**
   identifies the document as requiring legal, risk, and compliance analysis.
2. The
   **legal agent**
   extracts parties, payment terms, and obligations.
3. The
   **risk agent**
   identifies financial exposure and negotiation leverage points.
4. The
   **compliance agent**
   evaluates regulatory requirements and flags potential issues.
5. The
   **contract collaboration agent**
   consolidates findings into a comprehensive report.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Quick Suite, make sure you have:

* An AWS account with administrative permissions
