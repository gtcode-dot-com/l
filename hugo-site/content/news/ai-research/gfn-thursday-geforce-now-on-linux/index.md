Get ready to game — the native GeForce NOW app for Linux PCs is now available in beta, letting Linux desktops tap directly into GeForce RTX performance from the cloud.

Alongside the expansion comes ten new games, including
*The Bard’s Tale IV: Director’s Cut*
and
*The Bard’s Tale Trilogy*
for a leveled-up gaming weekend.

And operators can squad up in

*Delta Force*](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-flight-controls)
when it deploys in the cloud on February 3, bringing high-stakes tactical action to nearly any device with no downloads required.

## **Linux Just Got RTX**

Gaming on Linux just got a major RTX upgrade.

Starting with support for Ubuntu 24.04 and later, the new app delivers a seamless native experience that fits right into Linux desktop workflows. It transforms compatible Linux systems into high-performance GeForce RTX-powered rigs, streaming supported PC titles directly from the cloud at up to 5K resolution  and 120 frames per second, or 1080p at 360 fps.

This new desktop-focused app goes beyond the earlier Linux experience that was tuned specifically for Steam Decks, which targeted handheld-friendly resolutions and up to 1200p at 90 fps. The beta Linux app is built for PCs and notebooks, offering an experience similar to the existing GeForce NOW app on Windows and macOS.

With GeForce NOW, rendering happens in the cloud, so demanding titles run on a wider range of devices. Experience how RTX technologies — including ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and more — bring games to life with RTX 5080 performance from the cloud.

Linux PCs and devices join the GeForce NOW native app family that also supports Windows, macOS, Chromebooks, mobile devices, smart TVs and more — unlocking flexible, on-demand gaming anywhere.

## **Hot off the Cloud**

*One mountain, countless close calls.*

*Cairn*
is a survival-climbing adventure from The Game Bakers that pushes pro climber Aava up the unforgiving face of Mount Kami, a sheer giant that no one has ever managed to summit. Realistic climbing systems, resource management and route-planning turn each wall into a tense, puzzle-like challenge — blending simulation detail with atmospheric storytelling.
