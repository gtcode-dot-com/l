Step out of the vault and into the future of gaming with
*Fallout: New Vegas*
streaming on
[GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)
, just in time to celebrate the newest season of the hit Amazon TV show
*Fallout*
.

To mark the occasion, GeForce NOW members can claim
*Fallout 3*
and
*Fallout 4*
as special rewards, completing a wasteland-ready trilogy in the cloud.

Whether scavenging the ruins of post-apocalyptic America or rebuilding hope in the Wasteland, gamers can experience every choice — and every radroach — even sharper in the cloud.

Take a detour from the desert dust to the enchanted halls of Hogwarts in
*Hogwarts Legacy —*
and relive Harry’s years at school, brick by whimsical brick, in
*LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-7.*
This week’s GFN Thursday lineup of five games proves adventure comes in every form, from radiation to incantations.

Plus, GeForce NOW is joining Ubisoft to celebrate 10 years of
*Rainbow Six Siege*
: a decade of clutch plays and tactical showdowns streaming strong in the cloud.

## **Have Yourself a Merry Little ‘Fallout’**

*It’s a S.P.E.C.I.A.L. GFN Thursday.*

Bethesda’s
*Fallout: New Vegas*
is rolling onto GeForce NOW with a suitcase full of wasteland wit. Set in the Mojave Desert after a bombing, the title follows a courier carrying a valuable chip through a desert full of schemers, gamblers and nuclear scars.

The adventure drops players into a three- or more-way tug-of-war for the fate of New Vegas, where every decision can shift who runs the Strip and who ends up buried in the sand. Choices matter at every turn: talk fast, sneak smart or go loud, all while navigating sharp, darkly funny writing and factions that rarely fit cleanly into good or evil.​

In the cloud, the Mojave feels right at home, with high-fidelity visuals, fast response times and no need for a monster rig or huge downloads. The wasteland spins up in just seconds on underpowered laptops, phones and more, making it easier than ever to drop in for a quick caravan run or a long night on the Strip.

To sweeten the deal, GeForce NOW Ultimate members can claim a stack of classics — including
*Fallout 3*
and
*Fallout 4*
— while supplies last. It’s a tour of the
*Fallout*
universe, ready to stream from the cloud. Members can look for an email with details on how to redeem.

## **Magic Without the Wait**

GeForce NOW is making spirits bright this season with two enchanting adventures in the cloud. Step into the wizarding world with
*Hogwarts Legacy*
and relive the full saga of the “Boy Who Lived” in brick form with the
*LEGO Harry Potter Collection*
. Whether exploring the Forbidden Forest or causing mischief in Hogwarts, gamers can experience plenty of magic to go around.

It’s not sorcery, it’s the cloud.

In
*Hogwarts Legacy,*
players can chart their own path as a fifth-year student at Hogwarts in the 1800s. From learning powerful spells to taming magical beasts, the castle and its grounds are packed with secrets waiting to be discovered. It’s a world of intrigue, danger and wonder — with rich storytelling and breathtaking visuals that shine perfectly in the cloud.

GeForce NOW Ultimate members can experience the magic of Hogwarts like never before — every spell, shadow and shimmering corridor brought to life with GeForce RTX 5080-class power and
[NVIDIA DLSS 4](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/)
technology for spellbinding performance and ultrasmooth gameplay.

*No floo powder needed — just jump right in with GeForce NOW.*

The
*LEGO Harry Potter Collection*
offers a lighter, more playful spin on the saga, combining all seven years at Hogwarts into one charming package. Revisit major moments, cast silly spells and collect enough studs to make Gringotts jealous. It’s the ultimate magical mashup — family-friendly, full of humor and packed with puzzles and co-op fun.

No need for spells or waiting around for sorting — the magic starts right away with GeForce NOW. Members can stream both titles in jaw-dropping detail from nearly any device.

*No floo powder needed — just jump right in with GeForce NOW.*

*Rainbow Six Siege*
is turning 10, and the tactical chaos is streaming strong on GeForce NOW. For a full decade, squads have been breaching, droning and clutching rounds in one of the most precise, team-focused shooters around, instantly accessible from the cloud on a range of devices.

*Rainbow Six Siege*
is rolling out free in-game rewards all month to mark a decade of creativity, competition and tactical mastery. Players jumping into the game can look forward to a steady stream of goodies — from themed cosmetics to special packs and daily surprises — to commemorate the anniversary, on top of seasonal updates and the ever-evolving Operator roster.

Celebrate and stream the iconic game on GeForce NOW, with anniversary matches just a few clicks away — from quick warmups on a laptop to long sessions on the living room TV. Squads old and new can mark 10 unforgettable years of
*Rainbow Six Siege*
together in the cloud.

In addition, members can look for the following:

GeForce RTX 5080-ready games, in addition to
*Hogwarts Legacy*
:

* *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*
  (Steam and Ubisoft Connect)

Starting in January 2026, some games currently available to all members will no longer be available on the free tier as the basic rig type does not meet these games’ —
*Enshrouded, Alan Wake 2*
and
*Cities: Skylines II*
— minimum system requirements. Premium members can continue to play these games uninterrupted.
