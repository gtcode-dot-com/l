MIT senior Katie Spivakovsky has been selected as a 2026-27 Churchill Scholar and will undertake an MPhil in biological sciences at the Wellcome Sanger Institute at Cambridge University in the U.K. this fall.

Spivakovsky, who is double-majoring in biological engineering and artificial intelligence, with minors in mathematics and biology, aims to integrate computation and bioengineering in an academic research career focused on developing robust, scalable solutions that promote equitable health outcomes.

At MIT’s Bathe BioNanoLab, Spivakovsky investigates therapeutic applications of DNA origami, DNA-scaffolded nanoparticles for gene and mRNA delivery, and co-authored a manuscript in press at
*Science*
. She leads the development of an immune therapy for cancer cachexia with a team supported by MIT’s BioMakerSpace; this work earned a silver medal at the international synthetic biology competition iGEM and was published in the
*MIT Undergraduate Research Journal*
. Previously, she worked on Merck’s Modeling & Informatics team, characterizing a cancer-associated protein mutation, and at the New York Structural Biology Center, where she improved cryogenic electron microscopy particle detection models.

On campus, Spivakovsky serves as director of the Undergraduate Initiative in the MIT Biotech Group. She is deeply committed to teaching and mentoring, and has served as a lecturer and co-director for class 6.S095 (Probability Problem Solving), a teaching assistant for classes 20.309 (Bioinstrumentation) and 20.A06 (Hands-on Making in Biological Engineering), a lab assistant for 6.300 (Signal Processing), and as an associate advisor.

“Katie is a brilliant researcher who has a keen intellectual curiosity that will make her a leader in biological engineering in the future. We are proud that she will be representing MIT at Cambridge University,” says Kim Benard, associate dean of distinguished fellowships.

The Churchill Scholarship is a highly competitive fellowship that annually offers 16 American students the opportunity to pursue a funded graduate degree in science, mathematics, or engineering at Churchill College within Cambridge University. The scholarship, established in 1963, honors former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s vision for U.S.-U.K. scientific exchange. Since 2017, two Kanders Churchill Scholarships have also been awarded each year for studies in science policy.
