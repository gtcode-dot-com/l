## **The Biggest ‘Black Ops’ Ever**

In
*Call of Duty: Black Ops 7*
, Treyarch and Raven Software are bringing players the biggest Black Ops ever. The year is 2035, and the world teeters on the edge of collapse after the global events following

and
*Black Ops 6*
. Wielding cutting-edge technology, the Black Ops team led by David Mason must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else.

Step into the boots of David Mason and his elite Black Ops team as they fight against unseen forces that bend reality and reason. Squad up in an all-new Co-op Campaign designed for the biggest tactical play, unleash high-tech weaponry across a multiplayer experience brimming with new maps and modes, and descend once again into darkness with the next twisted chapter of Round-Based Zombies.

Stream
*Call of Duty: Black Ops 7*
today on GeForce NOW and play seamlessly across devices. The only way to play the game on Steam Deck is through GeForce NOW. Premium members get instant access with no waiting around for downloads, the highest frame rates, lowest latency and longer gaming sessions.

*Anno 117*
takes advantage of 5K 120 frames-per-second streaming for breathtaking detail and ultrasmooth performance, letting every brick, marketplace and coastline shine in cinematic clarity.
