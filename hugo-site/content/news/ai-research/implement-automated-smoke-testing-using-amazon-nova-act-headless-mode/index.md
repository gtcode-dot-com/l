Automated smoke testing using
[Amazon Nova Act](https://nova.amazon.com/act)
headless mode helps development teams validate core functionality in continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Development teams often deploy code several times daily, so fast testing helps maintain application quality. Traditional end-to-end testing can take hours to complete, creating delays in your CI/CD pipeline.

Smoke testing is a subset of testing that validates the most critical functions of an application work correctly after deployment. These tests focus on key workflows like user login, core navigation, and key transactions rather than exhaustive feature coverage. Smoke tests typically complete in minutes rather than hours, making them ideal for CI/CD pipelines where fast feedback on code changes is essential.

Amazon Nova Act uses AI-powered UI understanding and natural language processing to interact with web applications, replacing traditional CSS selectors. Instead of maintaining brittle CSS selectors and complex test scripts, you can write tests using simple English commands that adapt to UI changes.

This post shows how to implement automated smoke testing using Amazon Nova Act headless mode in CI/CD pipelines. We use
[SauceDemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)
, a sample ecommerce application, as our target for demonstration. We demonstrate setting up Amazon Nova Act for headless browser automation in CI/CD environments and creating smoke tests that validate key user workflows. We then show how to implement parallel execution to maximize testing efficiency, configure GitLab CI/CD for automatic test execution on every deployment, and apply best practices for maintainable and scalable test automation.

## Solution overview

The solution includes a Python test runner that executes smoke tests, ecommerce workflow validation for complete user journeys, GitLab CI/CD integration for automation, and parallel execution to speed up testing. Headless mode runs browser tests in the background without opening a browser window, which works well for automated testing.

The following diagram illustrates the testing workflow.

[![Linear workflow diagram illustrating GitLab continuous integration process with parallel testing and results analysis](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-1-3.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-1-3.png)

We walk through the following steps to implement automated smoke testing with Amazon Nova Act:

1. Set up your project and dependencies.
2. Create a smoke test with login validation.
3. Configure validation for the entire ecommerce workflow.
4. Configure the automated testing pipeline.
5. Configure parallel execution.

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you must have the following:

## Set up project and dependencies

Create your project and install dependencies:

```
# Create and navigate to project
uv init nova-act-smoke-tests
# Open in VS Code
code nova-act-smoke-tests
# Install required packages
uv add nova-act
```

UV is a fast Python package manager that handles dependency installation and virtual environment management automatically, similar to npm for Node.js projects.

### Create a test runner

Create
`smoke_tests.py`
:

```
import os
from nova_act import NovaAct

# Check API key
if not os.getenv("NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"):
  exit("❌ Set NOVA_ACT_API_KEY environment variable")
SAUCEDEMO_URL = "https://www.saucedemo.com/"
with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL) as nova:
  nova.act("Verify you are in the login page")

print("✅ Foundation setup complete!")
```

### Test your setup

Test your setup with the following commands:

```
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
uv run smoke_tests.py
```

Environment variables like
`NOVA_ACT_API_KEY`
keep sensitive information secure and separate from your code.

This solution implements the following security features:

* Stores API keys in environment variables or .env files (add
  `.env`
  to .
  `gitignore`
  )
* Uses different API keys for development, staging, and production environments
* Implements key rotation every 90 days using automated scripts or calendar reminders
* Monitors API key usage through logs to detect unauthorized access

You now have a modern Python project with Amazon Nova Act configured and ready for testing. Next, we show how to create a working smoke test that uses natural language browser automation.

## Create smoke test for login validation

Let’s expand your foundation code to include a complete login test with proper structure.

### Add main function and login test

Update
`smoke_tests.py`
:

```
import os
from nova_act import NovaAct

SAUCEDEMO_URL = "https://www.saucedemo.com/"

def test_login_flow():
    """Test complete login flow and product page verification"""
    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL) as nova:
        nova.act("Enter 'standard_user' in the username field")
        nova.act("Enter 'secret_sauce' in the password field")
        nova.act("Click the login button")
        nova.act("Verify Products appear on the page")

def main():
    # Check API key
    if not os.getenv("NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"):
        exit("❌ Set NOVA_ACT_API_KEY environment variable")

    print("🚀 Starting Nova Act Smoke Test")

    try:
        test_login_flow()
        print("✅ Login test: PASS")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Login test: FAIL - {e}")
        exit(1)

    print("🎉 All tests passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Test your login flow

Run your complete login test:

```
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
uv run smoke_tests.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
🚀 Starting NovaAct Smoke Test
✅ Login test: PASS
🎉 All tests passed!
```

Your smoke test now validates a complete user journey that uses natural language with Amazon Nova Act. The test handles page verification to confirm you’re on the login page, form interactions that enter user name and password credentials, action execution that clicks the login button, and success validation that verifies the products page loads correctly. The built-in error handling provides retry logic if the login process encounters any issues, showing how the AI-powered automation of Amazon Nova Act adapts to dynamic web applications without the brittleness of traditional CSS selector-based testing frameworks.

Although a login test provides valuable validation, real-world applications require testing complete user workflows that span multiple pages and complex interactions. Next, we expand the testing capabilities by building a comprehensive ecommerce journey that validates the entire customer experience.

## Configure ecommerce workflow validation

Let’s build a comprehensive ecommerce workflow that tests the end-to-end customer journey from login to logout.

### Add complete ecommerce test

Update
`smoke_tests.py`
to include the full workflow:

```
import os
from nova_act import NovaAct

SAUCEDEMO_URL = "https://www.saucedemo.com/"

def test_login_flow():
    """Test complete login flow and product page verification"""
    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL) as nova:
        nova.act("Enter 'standard_user' in the username field")
        nova.act("Enter 'secret_sauce' in the password field")
        nova.act("Click the login button")
        nova.act("Verify Products appear on the page")

def test_ecommerce_workflow():
    """Test complete e-commerce workflow: login → shop → checkout → logout"""
    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL) as nova:
        # Login
        nova.act("Enter 'standard_user' in the username field")
        nova.act("Enter 'secret_sauce' in the password field")
        nova.act("Click the login button")
        nova.act("Verify Products appear on the page")

        # Shopping
        nova.act("Select Sauce Labs Backpack")
        nova.act("Add Sauce Labs Backpack to the cart")
        nova.act("Navigate back to products page")
        nova.act("Select Sauce Labs Onesie")
        nova.act("Add Sauce Labs Onesie to the cart")
        nova.act("Navigate back to products page")

        # Cart verification
        nova.act("Click cart and Navigate to the cart page")
        nova.act("Verify 2 items are in the cart")

        # Checkout process
        nova.act("Click the Checkout button")
        nova.act("Enter 'John' in the First Name field")
        nova.act("Enter 'Doe' in the Last Name field")
        nova.act("Enter '12345' in the Zip/Postal Code field")
        nova.act("Click the Continue button")

        # Order completion
        nova.act("Verify Checkout:Overview page appears")
        nova.act("Click the Finish button")
        nova.act("Verify 'THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER' appears on the page")

        # Return and logout
        nova.act("Click the Back Home button")
        nova.act("Click the hamburger menu on the left")
        nova.act("Click the Logout link")
        nova.act("Verify the user is on the login page")
def main():
    # Check API key
    if not os.getenv("NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"):
        exit("❌ Set NOVA_ACT_API_KEY environment variable")

    print("🚀 Starting Nova Act E-commerce Tests")

    tests = [
        ("Login Flow", test_login_flow),
        ("E-commerce Workflow", test_ecommerce_workflow)
    ]

    passed = 0
    for test_name, test_func in tests:
        try:
            test_func()
            print(f"✅ {test_name}: PASS")
            passed += 1
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ {test_name}: FAIL - {e}")

    print(f"\n📊 Results: {passed}/{len(tests)} tests passed")

    if passed == len(tests):
        print("🎉 All tests passed!")
    else:
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Test your ecommerce workflow

Run your comprehensive test suite:

```
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
uv run smoke_tests.py
```

You should see the following output:

```
🚀 Starting Nova Act E-commerce Tests
✅ Login Flow: PASS
✅ E-commerce Workflow: PASS
📊 Results: 2/2 tests passed
🎉 All tests passed!
```

### Understanding the ecommerce journey

The workflow tests a complete customer experience:

* **Authentication**
  – Login with valid credentials
* **Product discovery**
  – Browse and select products
* **Shopping cart**
  – Add items and verify cart contents
* **Checkout process**
  – Enter shipping information
* **Order completion**
  – Complete purchase and verify success
* **Navigation**
  – Return to products and log out

The following screenshot shows the step-by-step visual guide of the user journey.

[![Interactive demonstration of online shopping checkout process from cart review to order confirmation](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-2.gif)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-2.gif)

Your smoke tests now validate complete user journeys that mirror real customer experiences. The ecommerce workflow shows how Amazon Nova Act handles complex, multi-step processes across multiple pages. By testing the entire customer journey from authentication through order completion, you’re validating the primary revenue-generating workflows in your application.

This approach reduces maintenance overhead while providing comprehensive coverage of your application’s core functionality.

Running these tests manually provides immediate value, but the real power comes from integrating them into your development workflow. Automating test execution makes sure code changes are validated against your critical user journeys before reaching production.

## Configure automated testing pipeline

With your comprehensive ecommerce workflow in place, you’re ready to integrate these tests into your CI pipeline. This step shows how to configure GitLab CI/CD to automatically run these smoke tests on every code change, making sure key user journeys remain functional throughout your development cycle. We show how to configure headless mode for CI environments while maintaining the visual debugging capabilities for local development.

### Add headless mode for CI/CD

Update
`smoke_tests.py`
to support headless mode for CI environments by adding the following lines to both test functions:

```
def test_login_flow():
    """Test complete login flow and product page verification"""
    headless = os.getenv("HEADLESS", "false").lower() == "true"

    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL, headless=headless) as nova:
        # ... rest of your test code remains the same

def test_ecommerce_workflow():
    """Test complete e-commerce workflow: login → shop → checkout → logout"""
    headless = os.getenv("HEADLESS", "false").lower() == "true"

    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL, headless=headless) as nova:
        # ... rest of your test code remains the same
```

### Create GitHub Actions workflow

GitLab CI/CD is GitLab’s built-in CI system that automatically runs pipelines when code changes occur. Pipelines are defined in YAML files that specify when to run tests and what steps to execute.

Create
`.gitlab-ci.yml`
:

```
stages:
  - test

smoke-tests:
  stage: test
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/python:v1.40.0-jammy
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "develop"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "web"
  before_script:
    - pip install uv
    - uv sync
    - uv run playwright install chromium
  script:
    - uv run python smoke_tests.py
  variables:
    HEADLESS: 'true'
    NOVA_ACT_SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL: 'true'
```

### Configure GitLab CI/CD variables

GitLab CI/CD variables provide secure storage for sensitive information like API keys. These values are encrypted and only accessible to your GitLab CI/CD pipelines. Complete the following steps to add a variable:

1. In your project, choose
   **Settings**
   ,
   **CI/CD**
   , and
   **Variables**
   .
2. Choose
   **Add variable**
   .
3. For the key, enter
   `NOVA_ACT_API_KEY`
   .
4. For the value, enter your Amazon Nova Act API key.
5. Select
   **Mask variable**
   to hide the value in job logs.
6. Choose
   **Add variable**
   .

### Understanding the code changes

The key change is the headless mode configuration:

```
headless = os.getenv("HEADLESS", "false").lower() == "true"
with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL, headless=headless) as nova:
```

This configuration provides flexibility for different development environments. During local development when the
`HEADLESS`
environment variable is not set, the headless parameter defaults to
`False`
, which opens a browser window so you can see the automation in action. This visual feedback is invaluable for debugging test failures and understanding how Amazon Nova Act interacts with your application. In CI/CD environments where
`HEADLESS`
is set to
`true`
, the browser runs in the background without opening any windows, making it ideal for automated testing pipelines that don’t have display capabilities and need to run efficiently without visual overhead.

### Test your CI/CD setup

Push your code to trigger the workflow:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Add Nova Act smoke tests with CI/CD"
git push origin main
```

Check the
**Pipelines**
section in your GitLab project to see the tests running.

[![GitLab pipeline view displaying running smoke tests with status indicators, branch info, and action controls](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-3-3.png)](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/08/image-3-3.png)

Your smoke tests now run automatically as part of your CI pipeline, providing immediate feedback on code changes. The GitLab CI/CD integration makes sure critical user journeys are validated before any deployment reaches production, reducing the risk of shipping broken functionality to customers.

The implementation shows how modern package management with UV reduces CI/CD pipeline execution time compared to traditional pip installations. Combined with secure API key management through GitLab CI/CD variables, your testing infrastructure follows enterprise security best practices.

As your test suite grows, you might notice that running tests sequentially can become a bottleneck in your deployment pipeline. The next section addresses this challenge by implementing parallel execution to maximize your CI/CD efficiency.

## Configure parallel execution

With your CI/CD pipeline successfully validating individual test cases, the next optimization focuses on performance enhancement through parallel execution. Concurrent test execution can reduce your total testing time by running multiple browser instances simultaneously, maximizing the efficiency of your CI/CD resources while maintaining test reliability and isolation.

### Add parallel execution framework

Update
`smoke_tests.py`
to support concurrent testing:

```
import os
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from nova_act import NovaAct

SAUCEDEMO_URL = "https://www.saucedemo.com/"
headless = os.getenv("HEADLESS", "false").lower() == "true"


def test_login_flow():
    """Test complete login flow and product page verification"""

    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL, headless=headless) as nova:
        nova.act("Enter 'standard_user' in the username field")
        nova.act("Enter 'secret_sauce' in the password field")
        nova.act("Click the login button")
        # nova.act("In case of error, make sure the username and password are correct, if required re-enter the username and password")
        nova.act("Verify Products appear on the page")

def test_ecommerce_workflow():
    """Test complete e-commerce workflow: login → shop → checkout → logout"""
    with NovaAct(starting_page=SAUCEDEMO_URL, headless=headless) as nova:
        # Login
        nova.act("Enter 'standard_user' in the username field")
        nova.act("Enter 'secret_sauce' in the password field")
        nova.act("Click the login button")
        nova.act("Verify Products appear on the page")

        # Shopping
        nova.act("Select Sauce Labs Backpack")
        nova.act("Add Sauce Labs Backpack to the cart")
        nova.act("Navigate back to products page")
        nova.act("Select Sauce Labs Onesie")
        nova.act("Add Sauce Labs Onesie to the cart")
        nova.act("Navigate back to products page")

        # Cart verification
        nova.act("Click cart and Navigate to the cart page")
        nova.act("Verify 2 items are in the cart")

        # Checkout process
        nova.act("Click the Checkout button")
        nova.act("Enter 'John' in the First Name field")
        nova.act("Enter 'Doe' in the Last Name field")
        nova.act("Enter '12345' in the Zip/Postal Code field")
        nova.act("Click the Continue button")

        # Order completion
        nova.act("Verify Checkout:Overview page appears")
        nova.act("Click the Finish button")
        nova.act("Verify 'THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER' appears on the page")

        # Return and logout
        nova.act("Click the Back Home button")
        nova.act("Click the hamburger menu on the left")
        nova.act("Click the Logout link")
        nova.act("Verify the user is on the login page")

def run_test(test_name, test_func):
    """Execute a single test and return result"""
    try:
        test_func()
        print(f"✅ {test_name}: PASS")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ {test_name}: FAIL - {e}")
        return False

def main():
    # Check API key
    if not os.getenv("NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"):
        exit("❌ Set NOVA_ACT_API_KEY environment variable")

    print("🚀 Starting Nova Act Tests (Parallel)")

    tests = [
        ("Login Flow", test_login_flow),
        ("E-commerce Workflow", test_ecommerce_workflow)
    ]

    # Configure parallel execution
    max_workers = int(os.getenv("MAX_WORKERS", "2"))

    # Run tests in parallel
    results = []
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        future_to_test = {
            executor.submit(run_test, name, func): name
            for name, func in tests
        }

        for future in as_completed(future_to_test):
            results.append(future.result())

    # Report results
    passed = sum(results)
    total = len(results)

    print(f"\n📊 Results: {passed}/{total} tests passed")

    if passed == total:
        print("🎉 All tests passed!")
    else:
        exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Update GitLab CI/CD for parallel execution

The parallel execution is already configured in your
`.gitlab-ci.yml`
with the
`MAX_WORKERS= "2"`
variable. The pipeline automatically uses the parallel framework when running the smoke tests.

### Test parallel execution

Run your optimized tests:

```
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export MAX_WORKERS="2"
uv run smoke_tests.py
```

You should see both tests running simultaneously:

```
🚀 Starting Nova Act Tests (Parallel)
✅ Login Flow: PASS
✅ E-commerce Workflow: PASS
📊 Results: 2/2 tests passed
🎉 All tests passed!
```

### Understanding parallel execution

`ThreadPoolExecutor`
is a Python class that manages a pool of worker threads, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously. In this case, each thread runs a separate browser test, reducing total execution time.

```
# Configure worker count
max_workers = int(os.getenv("MAX_WORKERS", "2"))

# Execute tests concurrently
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
    future_to_test = {
        executor.submit(run_test, name, func): name
        for name, func in tests
    }
```

Parallel execution provides benefits such as faster execution (because tests run simultaneously instead of sequentially), configurable workers that adjust based on system resources, resource efficiency that optimizes CI/CD compute time, and scalability that makes it straightforward to add more tests without increasing total runtime.

However, there are important considerations to keep in mind. Each test opens a browser instance (which increases resource usage), tests must be independent of each other to maintain proper isolation, and you must balance worker counts with available CPU and memory limits in CI environments.

Each parallel test uses system resources and incurs API usage. Start with two workers and adjust based on your environment’s capacity and cost requirements. Monitor your Amazon Nova Act usage to optimize the balance between test speed and expenses.

The performance improvement is significant when comparing sequential vs. parallel execution. In sequential execution, tests run one after another with the total time being the sum of all individual test durations. With parallel execution, multiple tests run simultaneously, completing in approximately the time of the longest test, resulting in substantial time savings that become more valuable as your test suite grows.

Your smoke tests now feature concurrent execution that significantly reduces total testing time while maintaining complete test isolation and reliability. The
`ThreadPoolExecutor`
implementation allows multiple browser instances to run simultaneously, transforming your sequential test suite into a parallel execution that completes much faster. This performance improvement becomes increasingly valuable as your test suite grows, so comprehensive validation doesn’t become a bottleneck in your deployment pipeline.

The configurable worker count through the
`MAX_WORKERS`
environment variable provides flexibility to optimize performance based on available system resources. In CI/CD environments, this allows you to balance test execution speed with resource constraints, and local development can use full system capabilities for faster feedback cycles. The architecture maintains complete test independence, making sure parallel execution doesn’t introduce flakiness or cross-test dependencies that could compromise reliability. As a best practice, keep tests independent—each test should work correctly regardless of execution order or other tests running simultaneously.

## Best practices

With your performance-optimized testing framework complete, consider the following practices for production readiness:

* Keep tests independent. Tests are not impacted by execution order or other tests running simultaneously.
* Add retry logic by wrapping your test functions in try-catch blocks with a retry mechanism for handling transient network issues.
* Configure your GitLab CI/CD pipeline with a reasonable timeout and consider adding a scheduled run for daily validation of your production environment.
* For ongoing maintenance, establish a rotation schedule for your Amazon Nova Act API keys and monitor your test execution times to catch performance regressions early. As your application grows, you can add new test functions to the parallel execution framework without impacting overall runtime, making this solution highly scalable for future needs.

## Clean up

To avoid incurring future charges and maintain security, clean up the resources you created:

1. Remove or disable unused GitLab CI/CD pipelines
2. Rotate API keys every 90 days and revoke unused keys.
3. Delete the repositories provided with this post.
4. Remove API keys from inactive projects.
5. Clear cached credentials and temporary files from your local environment.

## Conclusion

In this post, we showed how to implement automated smoke testing using Amazon Nova Act headless mode for CI/CD pipelines. We demonstrated how to create comprehensive ecommerce workflow tests that validate user journeys, implement parallel execution for faster test completion, and integrate automated testing with GitLab CI/CD for continuous validation.

The natural language approach using Amazon Nova Act needs less maintenance than traditional frameworks that use CSS selectors.
