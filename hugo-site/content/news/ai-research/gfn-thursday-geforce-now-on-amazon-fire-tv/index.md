The
[GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)
sixth-anniversary festivities roll on this February, continuing a monthlong celebration of NVIDIA’s cloud gaming service.

This week brings even more reasons to join the party, as GeForce NOW launches on a new platform with support for Amazon Fire TV devices, and eight new games to keep the streaming going strong.

The new app brings GeForce NOW directly to select Amazon Fire TV devices, so members can jump into their PC game libraries on the biggest screen in the house using a compatible controller.

## **The Cloud Turns Up the Heat**

GeForce NOW continues to expand access across devices, supporting multiple platforms with the latest additions of Linux. From PCs and Macs to smartphones, browsers and smart TVs, the cloud delivers high-performance gaming to nearly any screen, on more devices than ever.

Members tap into GeForce RTX power on the screens they already own, extending the value of their membership without extra hardware or complexity. That reach expands again with the launch of the GeForce NOW app on Amazon Fire TV.

GeForce NOW is powering up the living room with the launch of the
[GeForce NOW app](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-ces-2026-recap)
on
[Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=216294514011)
, leveling up big-screen gaming with PC-quality performance.

*GeForce RTX performance on Amazon Fire TV.*

The GeForce NOW app on Fire TV is
[available now](https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=2350149011)
with initial support for the Fire TV Stick 4K Plus (2nd Gen) with Fire OS 8.1.6.0 and later and Fire TV Stick 4K Max (2nd Gen)with Fire OS 8.1.6.0 and later, and Fire TV Stick 4K Max (1st Gen) with Fire OS 7.7.1.1 and later, streaming at up to 1080p60 with standard-dynamic-range graphics using H.264 video encoding and stereo audio. Fire TV owners now have an even more powerful way to play on the big screen.

Connect a controller, open the app and stream favorite titles instantly with RTX power behind every pixel — no console required. Cloud gaming has never felt more at home.

## **Stories From the Ninth World**

![Torment Tides of Numenera on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GFN_Thursday-Torment_Tides_of_Numenera-1680x840.jpg)


*Words hit harder than weapons.*

*Torment: Tides of Numenera*
, inXile Entertainment’s story-focused role-playing game, puts emphasis on choices, characters and dialogue, mixing science fiction and fantasy into a strange, colorful world where every conversation and decision matters.

The adventure takes place in the “Ninth World,” a far-future version of Earth built on the ruins of incredibly advanced civilizations. Step into the role of the Last Castoff, a person connected to a powerful, mysterious figure, and get pulled into a mystery that asks one big question: What does a single life truly mean? Expect memorable companions, tough moral choices and plenty of odd, fascinating situations rather than a typical hero-saves-the-world story.

On GeForce NOW, this story-heavy experience is easy to jump into, no high-end rig required. Gaming sessions can pick up right where they left off across supported devices, making it simple for gamers to sink back into the Ninth World whenever the story calls.
