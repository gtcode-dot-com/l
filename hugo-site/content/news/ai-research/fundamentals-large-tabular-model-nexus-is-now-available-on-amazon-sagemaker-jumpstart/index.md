Today, we’re announcing support for Fundamental’s NEXUS model on
[Amazon SageMaker AI](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/)
. With this launch, you can deploy a foundation model (FM) purpose-built for tabular data prediction. This model helps your enterprise generate accurate, deterministic predictions from structured data in days instead of months.

In this post, we show you how to get started with NEXUS on
[Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/jumpstart/)
, walk through the deployment process, and demonstrate how to run predictions against your enterprise datasets.

## What is NEXUS?

NEXUS is a foundation model developed by
[Fundamental](https://fundamental.tech/)
and built for tabular data prediction. Large language models (LLMs) are designed for text, and traditional machine learning (ML) approaches require extensive feature engineering and model training. NEXUS takes a different approach. It’s pre-trained on billions of real-world prediction tasks across structured datasets, so it arrives already knowing how to find signal in your data.

As a Large Tabular Model, NEXUS is built for structured data analysis and offers these key innovations:

* **Deterministic architecture**
  – Probabilistic LLMs might provide different answers to identical queries. NEXUS produces consistent, reproducible results for each individual prediction.
* **Native tabular understanding**
  – Trained on billions of tables, NEXUS natively processes numbers, categories, dates, and unstructured text without manual feature engineering.
* **Non-sequential reasoning**
  – Most AI models predict sequential data (for example, the next word or the next pixel). NEXUS analyzes multi-dimensional relationships in enterprise tables. For example, when predicting customer churn, NEXUS understands how multiple factors (transaction frequency, support tickets, and economic indicators) impact the likelihood of attrition.

## Why existing approaches fall short

The most valuable enterprise data sits in tables such as spreadsheets, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and relational databases. Many critical business decisions depend on predictions made against this data. However, today’s tools have significant limitations:

* **Traditional ML**
  takes teams of data scientists 3–6 months to build, train, and deploy a model for a single use case. You face a constant trade-off between quality and quantity of predictions.
* **LLMs**
  are non-deterministic, producing different answers on the same dataset. They lose numerical context during tokenization, which leads to inaccurate results on structured data and requires complex guardrails to mitigate these issues.

NEXUS is architected for tabular data and provides advantages such as the following:

* **Permutation invariance**
  – Recognizes that changing column order doesn’t change meaning, which differs from how transformers handle data.
* **Billion-row capability**
  – Processes massive datasets without truncation or sampling.
* **Cross-schema reasoning**
  – Connects related data across disparate tables automatically.
* **Autonomous data cleaning**
  – Resolves incomplete entries (for example, NEXUS can still make predictions even when entries are missing).

## How NEXUS works on Amazon SageMaker AI

The following figure illustrates the end-to-end flow for deploying and running predictions with NEXUS on SageMaker AI.

![End-to-end architecture diagram showing the NEXUS deployment flow on Amazon SageMaker AI, including subscription on AWS Marketplace, endpoint deployment, SDK connection, data upload to Amazon S3, and prediction output.](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2026/05/21/ML-20964-1.png)

NEXUS runs on a dedicated, single-tenant, network-isolated GPU instance within the SageMaker AI managed environment. The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Subscribe and deploy**
   – Subscribe to the NEXUS model package on
   [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace)
   , then deploy it as a SageMaker AI managed inference endpoint on an
   `ml.p5en.48xlarge`
   instance (8× NVIDIA H200 GPUs).
2. **Install the SDK**
   – Install the Fundamental Python SDK and connect it to your SageMaker endpoint. The SDK provides a familiar scikit-learn compatible API with
   `NEXUSClassifier`
   and
   `NEXUSRegressor`
   estimators.
3. **Upload data to Amazon S3**
   – The SDK serializes your tabular data and uploads it to an
   [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
   bucket in your account.
4. **Train a model**
   – Call
   `clf.fit(X_train, y_train)`
   to train. NEXUS handles data cleanup and feature engineering automatically, with no manual pipeline required.
5. **Generate predictions**
   – Call
   `clf.predict(X_test)`
   for deterministic predictions or
   `clf.predict_proba(X_test)`
   for probability estimates. Results are stored back in your Amazon S3 bucket.

Your data stays in your AWS environment throughout this process. The endpoint is network-isolated and single-tenant, which makes NEXUS suitable for enterprise workloads with sensitive data.

## Get started with NEXUS on Amazon SageMaker AI
