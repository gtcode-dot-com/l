NVIDIA will join the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE)
[Genesis Mission](https://genesis.energy.gov/)
as a private industry partner to keep U.S. AI both the leader and the standard in technology around the world.

The Genesis Mission, which is part of an Executive Order recently signed by President Trump, aims to redefine American leadership in AI across three key areas: energy, scientific research and national security. NVIDIA will offer its services to the Department to integrate a discovery platform that unites the U.S. government, industry and academia.

DOE officials expect the Genesis Mission to double the productivity and impact of American science and engineering, and deliver decisive breakthroughs to secure American energy dominance, accelerate scientific discovery and strengthen national security.

NVIDIA and the DOE are already achieving groundbreaking results in key areas, including:

* Open AI science models, such as with
  [NVIDIA Apollo](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/apollo-open-models/)
  family, to advance weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics and structural mechanics;
* AI for optimizing manufacturing and supply chain processes;
* Robotics, edge AI and autonomous labs, including through the use of high-fidelity simulation and AI-enabled digital twins;
* Nuclear energy, including fission and fusion research;
* Quantum computing research, using supercomputers and AI to accelerate the discovery of new algorithms;
* Biology, materials science and synthetic design for healthcare; and critical-materials breakthroughs.

## **NVIDIA, DOE Announce MOU**

In addition, NVIDIA announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department to outline priorities of the collaboration in support of accelerating scientific discovery.

The MOU includes, but is not limited to, AI for manufacturing and supply chain, open-source AI, fission energy, robotics, AI-enabled digital twins, fusion energy, quantum computing and science.

Together, these priorities focus on using advanced AI, robotics and high‑performance computing to transform energy, manufacturing and scientific discovery across the Department of Energy mission space. They emphasize AI-enabled design, operation and control of complex systems, such as nuclear fission and fusion reactors, experimental facilities, digital twins of infrastructure and autonomous laboratories, including at the edge for real-time decision-making.

Additional opportunities for collaboration may include accelerating breakthroughs in quantum computing, materials science, biology and synthetic design, subsurface and geothermal resources, and environmental cleanup, as well as open science-optimized AI models and AI “co-scientists” that speed algorithm development and code generation for demanding scientific applications.​

## **Building on Supercomputing Collaborations**

NVIDIA’s support of the Genesis Mission comes on the heels of a series of collaborations between NVIDIA and the DOE made during the NVIDIA GTC Washington, D.C., conference, including
[NVIDIA and Oracle working together to build the Department’s largest supercomputer for scientific research](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-oracle-us-department-of-energy-ai-supercomputer-scientific-discovery)
at Argonne National Laboratory. This is in addition to
[news that NVIDIA will support seven new systems](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-partners-ai-infrastructure-america)
across Argonne and Los Alamos National Laboratories, accelerating the DOE’s mission of driving technological leadership.

NVIDIA pioneered the accelerated computing architecture that makes modern AI possible — a platform that enables researchers to train large models, simulate physical systems and advance science at unprecedented scale and speed.

AI is driving a new industrial revolution in the U.S. and across the world. The Genesis Mission is expected to expand and accelerate that revolution.
