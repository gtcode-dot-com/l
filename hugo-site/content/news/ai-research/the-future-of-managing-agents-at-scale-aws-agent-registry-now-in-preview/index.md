*Now available through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, use AWS Agent Registry to discover, share, and reuse agents, tools, and agent skills across your organization.*

As enterprises scale to hundreds or thousands of agents, platform teams face three critical challenges: visibility (knowing what agents exist across the organization), control (governing who can publish and what becomes discoverable organization-wide), and reuse (preventing teams from rebuilding capabilities that already exist). Without a centralized system, agent sprawl accelerates, compliance risks grow, and development effort is wasted on duplicate work. These challenges are compounded by reality: no organization’s agent landscape lives entirely within one provider. Agents are built across AWS services, other cloud platforms, and on-premises environments. A registry that only covers part of the stack leaves the rest invisible, and invisible agents can’t be discovered, governed, or reused. Solving this requires more than a place to list what exists. Platform teams need to build agents, publish them with approval workflows, help teams to discover and reuse what exists, govern who can publish and consume, monitor what’s running in production, and retire what’s no longer needed. Today, we’re announcing AWS Agent Registry (preview) in AgentCore, a single place to discover, share, and reuse AI agents, tools, and agent skills across your enterprise.

[AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/)
is the platform to build, connect, and optimize agents at scale, designed from the ground up for agents: open to any model, any framework, any enterprise architecture. Whether you’re shipping your first agent or your thousandth, you have one platform that scales with you. The registry extends that same flexibility to how you organize and govern what you’ve built. It indexes agents regardless of where they’re built or hosted – on AWS, other cloud providers, or on premises.

## **What’s available in preview today**

The registry stores metadata for every agent, tool, MCP server, agent skill, and custom resources as a structured record. It captures who published each record, what protocols it implements, what it exposes, and how to invoke it. The registry supports established standards like MCP and A2A natively, with the flexibility to define custom schemas for your organization. There are two ways to register a record. You can provide metadata manually through the console, AWS SDK, or API, specifying capability descriptions, ownership, compliance status, and usage documentation. Or you can point to an MCP or A2A endpoint, and the registry will automatically pull in the details. Your registry can reflect your full agent landscape from day one, not only the pieces that happen to run on AWS.

The registry is accessible through the AgentCore
[Console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/registry?region=us-east-1)
, APIs, and as an MCP server. Any MCP-compatible client can query it directly, including Kiro and Claude Code. For organizations with custom identity providers, OAuth-based access means that teams can build their own discovery UIs without requiring IAM credentials.

### ***Finding what already exists***

Without a central registry, developers search externally for third-party tools or duplicate work that a neighboring team already shipped. You lose visibility into what’s been built, who owns it, and whether it’s approved for use. The registry solves this with hybrid search that combines keyword and semantic matching: all queries use keyword matching, but longer, natural language queries also use semantic understanding to surface conceptually related results. This means a search for “payment processing” surfaces tools tagged as “billing” or “invoicing,” even if they’re named differently. Discovery becomes the path of least resistance. Teams can search by name, descriptions, and resource type to find what already exists before building something new. Developers search the registry first. If a vetted capability exists, they use it. If it doesn’t, they build it, register it, and make it available to everyone else. You can see what exists across your organization.

> *For Zuora, an AI-first monetization and revenue management platform deploying 50 agents across Sales, Finance, Product, and Developer teams, the AWS Agent Registry in AgentCore gives Principal Architects a unified view to discover, manage, and catalog every agent, tool, and skill in use. This centralized approach enables teams to find and reuse existing assets rather than rebuilding from scratch. Standardized metadata ensures each agent and tool includes consistent details on ownership and capabilities, giving teams end-to-end visibility and accountability across the entire agent ecosystem.*

### ***Governing what gets published***

Without governance, anyone can register anything. You lose control over what becomes discoverable, can’t enforce standards, can’t track ownership, and can’t manage agents from development to retirement. When you have a few agents, you can manage them in a spreadsheet. When you have hundreds or thousands, you need a system that enforces standards automatically.

The registry gives you control over what gets published and who can access it. Admins use IAM policies to define who can register agents, tools, and agent skills and who can discover them. Every record follows an approval workflow: they start as drafts, move to pending approval, and become discoverable to the broader organization once approved. The registry tracks agents across their entire lifecycle, from initial development through deployment to eventual retirement. Records are versioned to track changes over time, and organizations can deprecate records that are no longer in use. The registry provides hooks to integrate your existing approval workflows. You can add custom metadata to each entry through a record, capturing information like team ownership, compliance status, or deployment environment.

> *Southwest Airlines is enabling an enterprise-wide agent catalog and governance across the enterprise. AWS Agent Registry in AgentCore solves the critical discoverability challenge— enabling teams to find and reuse existing agents instead of rebuilding capabilities from scratch. With managed governance across multiple platforms, every agent carries standardized ownership metadata and policy enforcement. This will prevent agent sprawl across the organization while establishing the foundation for scaling thousands of agents with enterprise-grade governance from day one.*

## **Where we’re headed**

We’re building toward a future where the registry spans every AWS service where agents are built, including Amazon Quick, and Kiro. Agents will be automatically indexed the moment that they’re deployed. Developers will search from the IDE, business users will discover agents in their workspace, and admins will govern from the console, all backed by the same source of truth. Cross-registry federation will let you connect multiple registries and search across them as one. You will be able to define categories and taxonomies that match how your organization thinks about agents, backed by structured metadata schemas capturing ownership, compliance status, cost center, and whatever else your governance model requires. Over time, operational intelligence from AgentCore Observability will surface alongside registry records: invocation counts, latency, uptime, and usage patterns, helping you to understand not only what exists, but what’s actively working in production.

Beyond AWS Agent Registry, we’re building toward connecting with external partner catalogs. We’re excited about early partner interest in centralized discovery and governance across your technology landscape.

## **Get started**

Today’s preview is the starting line. No more rebuilding what already exists. No more agents deployed without visibility. The AWS Agent Registry gives you one place to discover, govern, and reuse every agent across your enterprise.

AWS Agent Registry is available in preview today through AgentCore in five
