Accurate weather forecasting helps save lives and protect environments — and is a cornerstone of decision-making in agriculture, energy, public health and other industries.

Researchers, weather agencies, climate-tech innovators and enterprises are already running, fine-tuning and building on these state-of-the-art models to unlock scientific breakthroughs using their own local AI infrastructure.

### ***Weather Forecasting***

AI weather tool provider
**Brightband**
— a member of the
[NVIDIA Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/)
program’s
[Sustainable Futures](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/earth-day-2024-climate-tech-ai-startups/)
initiative —
[is running Earth-2 Medium Range](https://www.brightband.com/company/news/earth2-medium-range-model)
to issue real-world global forecasts daily.

“The revolution of new AI weather tools for forecasting is very exciting and continues to gather speed with new models like NVIDIA Earth-2 Medium Range,” said Julian Green, cofounder and CEO of Brightband. “Brightband is among the first to run Earth-2 Medium Range operationally, and the model being open source speeds up innovation, allowing easier comparison and improvements by other members of the weather enterprise.”

The
**Israel Meteorological Service**
[is using Earth-2 CorrDiff](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/case-studies/israel-meteorological-service/)
in operation — and plans to use Earth-2 Nowcasting — to generate high-resolution forecasts up to eight times daily, enabling decision-makers to respond more effectively to extreme weather while reducing computational costs.

“NVIDIA Earth-2 models give us a 90% reduction in compute time at 2.5-kilometer resolution compared with running a classic numerical weather prediction model without AI on a CPU cluster,” said Amir Givati, director of the Israel Meteorological Service. “After a recent rainstorm, our AI model trained with CorrDiff was the best of all our operational models for a six-hour verification of accumulated precipitation.”

**The Weather Company**
is evaluating Earth-2 Nowcasting for localized severe-weather applications, and
**NWS**
is evaluating the new models to enhance its operational workflows.

### ***Energy Forecasting and Grid Operations***

**TotalEnergies**
is evaluating Earth-2 Nowcasting to improve short-term risk awareness and decision-making.

“NVIDIA Earth-2 represents a major step forward in how advanced weather intelligence can be operationalized at scale,” said Emmanuel Le Borgne, climate and weather forecast product manager at TotalEnergies. “Models like Earth-2 Nowcasting are groundbreaking for our business because they improve short-term risk awareness and decision-making in energy systems where minutes and local impacts matter.”

**Eni**
is intensively testing Earth-2 models, including FourCastNet and CorrDiff, for semi-operational downscaling of predictions to produce probabilistic, high-resolution forecasts of weather and gas demand weeks ahead.

**GCL**
, one of China’s largest solar material producers and a global integrated energy operator, is running NVIDIA Earth-2 models in operation for its photovoltaic prediction system. Compared with traditional numerical weather prediction, Earth-2 provides more accurate prediction data at a lower cost, significantly improving the accuracy of GCL’s photovoltaic power generation prediction.

**Southwest Power Pool**
, in collaboration with
**Hitachi**
, is using Earth-2 Nowcasting and FourCastNet3 to improve intraday and day-ahead wind forecasting. This effort supports Southwest Power Pool’s commitment to enhancing grid reliability and enabling more informed operational decisions across the SPP footprint.

### ***Financial Impact Assessment***

**S&P Global Energy**
is harnessing NVIDIA Earth-2 CorrDiff to turn climate data into local insights for risk assessment. Global insurance group
**AXA**
is
[using FourCastNet](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/spotlight-axa-explores-ai-driven-hurricane-risk-assessment-with-nvidia-earth-2/)
to generate thousands of hypothetical hurricane scenarios as part of its R&D program in model evaluation, methodological development and benchmarking on existing techniques.
