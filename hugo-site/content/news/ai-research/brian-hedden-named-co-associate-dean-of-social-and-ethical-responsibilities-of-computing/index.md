[Brian Hedden](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/brian-hedden/)
PhD ’12 has been appointed co-associate dean of the Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) at MIT, a cross-cutting initiative in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, effective Jan. 16.

Hedden is a professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, holding an MIT Schwarzman College of Computing shared position with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). He joined the MIT faculty last fall from the Australian National University and the University of Sydney, where he previously served as a faculty member. He earned his BA from Princeton University and his PhD from MIT, both in philosophy.

“Brian is a natural and compelling choice for SERC, as a philosopher whose work speaks directly to the intellectual challenges facing education and research today, particularly in computing and AI. His expertise in epistemology, decision theory, and ethics addresses questions that have become increasingly urgent in an era defined by information abundance and artificial intelligence. His scholarship exemplifies the kind of interdisciplinary inquiry that SERC exists to advance,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.

Hedden’s research focuses on how we ought to form beliefs and make decisions, and it explores how philosophical thinking about rationality can yield insights into contemporary ethical issues, including ethics of AI. He is the author of “Reasons without Persons: Rationality, Identity, and Time” (Oxford University Press, 2015) and articles on topics such as collective action problems, legal standards of proof, algorithmic fairness, and political polarization.

Joining co-associate dean Nikos Trichakis, the J.C. Penney Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, Hedden will help lead SERC and advance the initiative’s ongoing research, teaching, and engagement efforts. He succeeds professor of philosophy

, who stepped down at the conclusion of his three-year term on Sept. 1, 2025.

Since its inception in 2020, SERC has launched a range of programs and activities designed to cultivate responsible “habits of mind and action” among those who create and deploy computing technologies, while fostering the development of technologies in the public interest.

The
[SERC Scholars Program](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/)
invites undergraduate and graduate students to work alongside postdoctoral mentors to explore interdisciplinary ethical challenges in computing. The initiative also hosts an
[annual prize competition](https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/envisioning-the-future-of-computing-prize-home/)
that challenges MIT students to envision the future of computing, publishes a twice-yearly series of
[case studies](https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/)
, and collaborates on coordinated
[curricular materials](https://computing.mit.edu/news/learning-to-think-critically-about-machine-learning/)
, including active-learning projects, homework assignments, and in-class demonstrations. In 2024, SERC introduced a
[new seed grant program](https://computing.mit.edu/news/inaugural-serc-seed-grants-aim-to-advance-ethical-and-responsible-computing-practices/)
to support MIT researchers investigating ethical technology development; to date,
[two rounds](https://computing.mit.edu/news/second-round-of-serc-seed-grants-award-to-mit-scholars/)
of grants have been awarded to 24 projects.
