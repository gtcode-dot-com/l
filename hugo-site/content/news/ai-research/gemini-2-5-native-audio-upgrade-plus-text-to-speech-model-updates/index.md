## Live Speech Translation

Gemini now natively supports new live speech-to-speech translation capabilities designed to handle both continuous listening and two-way conversation.

With continuous listening, Gemini automatically translates speech in multiple languages into a single target language. This allows you to put headphones in and hear the world around you in your language.

For two-way conversation, Gemini’s live speech translation handles translation between two languages in real-time, automatically switching the output language based on who is speaking. For example, if you speak English and want to chat with a Hindi speaker, you’ll hear English translations in real-time in your headphones, while your phone broadcasts Hindi when you’re done speaking.

Gemini’s live speech translation has a number of key capabilities that help in the real world:

* **Language coverage**
  : Translates speech in over 70 languages and 2000 language pairs by combining Gemini model’s world knowledge and multilingual capabilities with its native audio capabilities
* **Style transfer:**
  Captures the nuance of human speech, preserving the speaker’s intonation, pacing and pitch so the translation sounds natural.
* **Multilingual input:**
  Understands multiple languages simultaneously in a single session, helping you follow multilingual conversations without needing to fiddle around with language settings.
* **Auto detection:**
  Identifies the spoken language and begins translation, so you don’t even need to know what language is being spoken to start translating.
* **Noise robustness**
  : Filters out ambient noise so you can converse comfortably even in loud, outdoor environments.
