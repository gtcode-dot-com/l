NVIDIA is wrapping up a big week at the CES trade show with a set of
[GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)
announcements that are bringing more ways to play and more games to the cloud.

From new native apps for Linux and Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks to hands-on throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) support for simulation fans and a new single sign-on option, GeForce NOW is expanding across devices and making it easier to jump straight into gameplay.

Topping it off, a new wave of AAA titles — including IO Interactive’s
*007 First Light*
, Capcom’s
*Resident Evil Requiem*
and Pearl Abyss’
*Crimson Desert*
— is gearing up to join the GeForce NOW library for high-fidelity, low-latency streaming across the globe.

Get ready with the six new games available to stream this week.

## **Leveling Up Where Gamers Play**

*The family of GeForce NOW supported devices is growing.*

A new native GeForce NOW app is launching in beta for Linux, starting with Ubuntu 24.04 and later. This answers a long-standing request from the gaming community, turning compatible systems into RTX-powered gaming rigs that can stream at up to 5K resolution and 120 frames per second (fps) or 1080p 360 fps. With rendering handled in the cloud, Linux gamers can tap into ray tracing,
[NVIDIA DLSS](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/)
and other RTX features without needing a local, high-end GPU.​

*Things are heating up: GeForce NOW on Fire TV streaming sticks.*

A new native app for Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks transforms the tiny device into a big-screen cloud gaming endpoint, giving members another way to stream their PC libraries straight to the TV with a gamepad in hand. It builds on existing device support, making it easier for gamers to pick up and play from the couch without a console or gaming PC attached.​

## **Clearer Skies Ahead**

*Cleared for takeoff in the cloud.*

Flight control support has landed in the cloud, letting virtual pilots connect their favorite gear — including industry-leading Thrustmaster and Logitech setups — to custom HOTAS configurations. Whether locking in a full desktop throttle-and-stick rig or fine-tuning a split cockpit arrangement, everything’s ready for takeoff.

Paired with the incredible RTX 5080-powered performance available to Ultimate members, plus ultralow-latency streaming and

in supported titles, pilots can now enjoy ultra-precise, hyper-immersive flight experiences straight from the cloud. Soaring over detailed landscapes in
*Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024*
, dogfighting in
*War Thunder*
or exploring the stars in
*Elite Dangerous*
has never felt smoother.

## **Easier Sign-Ins, Faster Game Time**

GeForce NOW now supports new games — and more ways to get into them faster.

*Because remembering passwords is so last season.*

Battle.net single sign-on recently joined the service, letting members jump straight into supported titles without juggling extra credentials each time. And coming soon early this year, Gaijin.net integration will make takeoff even smoother — one simple sign-on connects more game libraries across devices.

Fewer passwords and pop-ups mean more time playing — whether on a desktop, laptop, handheld device or TV.

## **Next Up in the Cloud**

A new wave of AAA titles is headed to GeForce NOW, bringing spies, survivors and freeswords to the cloud for members to stream across their favorite devices. The games each bring a distinct flavor — from stealthy espionage to nerve-shredding horror and gritty fantasy combat — and they’re all gearing up to join an already-stacked GeForce NOW library when they launch on PC.

![007 on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-007_First_Light-1680x840.jpg)


*Earn the number.*

IO Interactive’s
*007 First Light*
brings a modern James Bond origin story to the cloud when the PC title launches May 27, inviting members to step into the shadows as Bond begins his journey. Experience a balanced mix of stealth and action built around a “breathing” gameplay loop with IOI’s cinematic, set-piece-driven storytelling. Approach encounters through stealth, direct action or creative improvisation, with multiple viable paths to each objective that let players define Bond’s style.

![Resident Evil Requiem](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Resident_Evil_Requiem-1680x840.jpg)


*Welcome to the Wrenwood Hotel — late checkout is not recommended.*

Capcom’s
*Resident Evil Requiem*
continues the legendary survival-horror saga with a new chapter that doubles down on tense exploration, eerie environments and resource-tight combat. Expect dimly lit corridors, unsettling encounters and that classic feeling of weighing every bullet and healing item before moving forward when playing as Grace, and exhilarating, death-defying action when playing as Leon.

![Active Matter on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Active_Matter-1680x840.jpg)


*Everything matters in the cloud.*

Gaijin Entertainment’s
*Active Matter,*
coming this year
*,*
is a realistic military shooter where players join dangerous raids for loot or intense player vs. player battles set in a fractured multiverse. Active matter can be harvested from active matter-transformed creatures or seized from other players. Join this never-ending hunt to improve the chances to find the way out of the time loop.

![Crimson Desert on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Crimson_Desert-1680x840.jpg)


*Open world, closed casket.*

Pearl Abyss’
*Crimson Desert*
is a stunning open-world action adventure set in a war-torn fantasy land, pairing large-scale exploration with cinematic storytelling and hard-hitting, combo-focused combat. One moment is a quiet ride across windswept plains, the next is a chaotic clash against towering foes with mystical power effects lighting up the battlefield.

Playing these titles on GeForce NOW means jumping into big-budget experiences with RTX 5080-class performance, high frame rates and advanced graphics features on a wide range of devices, without worrying about downloads, patches or local hardware requirements. Members can pick up the same adventure on a desktop, laptop, handheld device or TV, letting each of these worlds shine wherever and however they choose to play.

## **Hello New Games**

![Pathological on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Pathological-1680x840.jpg)


*Welcome back to the plague.*

The eerie world of
*Pathologic 3*
, from Ice-Pick Lodge and tinyBuild, invites players to step once again into a haunting town teetering on the edge of disaster. Time is fleeting, trust is scarce and every conversation feels like a test of loyalty — or survival. With its signature blend of tension, philosophy and dark humor,
*Pathologic 3*
doesn’t just tell a story; it dares players to live through it.

In addition, members can look for the following:
