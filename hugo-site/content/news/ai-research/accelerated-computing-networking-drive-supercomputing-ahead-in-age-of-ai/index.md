As AI factories grow to unprecedented sizes, networks must evolve to keep pace. By eliminating traditional pluggable transceivers, a common cause of job runtime failures, NVIDIA Photonics switch systems not only deliver 3.5x better power efficiency, but also perform with 10x higher resiliency, enabling applications to run 5x longer without interruption.

At GTC 2024 in Silicon Valley, NVIDIA unveiled NVIDIA Quantum-X800 InfiniBand switches, purpose-built to power trillion-parameter-scale generative AI models. These platforms deliver a staggering 800Gb/s end-to-end throughput — 2x the bandwidth and 9x the in-network compute of their predecessors — owing to such innovations as SHARPv4 and FP8 support.

As NVIDIA Quantum‑X800 continues to be widely adopted to meet the demands of massive-scale AI, NVIDIA Quantum‑X Photonics, announced at GTC earlier this year, addresses the critical power, resiliency, and signal-integrity challenges of even larger deployments. By integrating optics directly on the switch, it eliminates failures caused by pluggable transceivers and link flaps, enabling workloads to run uninterrupted at scale and ensuring the infrastructure can support the next generation of compute-intensive applications up to 5x better than with pluggable transceivers.

“NVIDIA Quantum‑X Photonics represents the next step in building high-performance, resilient AI networks,” said Maxx Garrison, product manager for cloud infrastructure at Lambda. “These advances in power efficiency, signal integrity and reliability, will be key to supporting efficient, large-scale workloads for our customers.”

SHARPv4 enables in-network aggregation and reduction, minimizing GPU-to-GPU communication overhead. Combined with FP8 precision, it accelerates training of trillion-parameter models by reducing bandwidth and compute demands — delivering faster convergence and higher throughput and comes standard with NVIDIA Quantum‑X800 and Quantum‑X Photonics switches.

“CoreWeave is building the Essential Cloud for AI,” said Peter Salanki, co-founder and chief technology officer at CoreWeave. “With NVIDIA Quantum-X Photonics, we’re advancing power efficiency, and further improving the reliability CoreWeave is known for in supporting massive AI workloads at scale, helping our customers unlock the full potential of next-generation AI.”

The NVIDIA Quantum-X Photonics platform, anchored by the NVIDIA Quantum Q3450 CPO-based InfiniBand switch and ConnectX-8 SuperNIC, is engineered for the highest-performance environments that also require significantly lower power, higher resiliency and lower latency.

## **Supercomputing Centers Worldwide Adopting NVQLink**

![](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NVIDIANVQLink.jpg)

More than a dozen of the world’s top scientific computing centers are adopting

## **Arm Adopting NVIDIA NVLink Fusion [🔗](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-computing-networking-supercomputing-ai/#arm)**

AI is reshaping data centers in a once-in-a-generation architectural shift, where efficiency per watt defines success. At the center is Arm Neoverse, deployed in over a billion cores and projected to reach 50% hyperscaler market share by 2025. Every major provider — AWS, Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Meta — is building on Neoverse, underscoring its role in powering AI at scale.

To meet surging demand, Arm is extending Neoverse with NVIDIA NVLink Fusion, the high-bandwidth, coherent interconnect first pioneered with Grace Blackwell. NVLink Fusion links CPUs, GPUs, and accelerators into one unified rack-scale architecture, removing memory and bandwidth bottlenecks that limit AI performance. Connected with Arm’s AMBA CHI C2C protocol, it ensures seamless data movement between Arm-based CPUs and partners’ preferred accelerators.

Together, Arm and NVIDIA are setting a new standard for AI infrastructure, enabling ecosystem partners to build differentiated, energy-efficient systems that accelerate innovation across the AI era.

“Folks building their own ARM CPU, or using an Arm IP can actually have access to NVLink Fusion, be able to connect that ARM CPU to an Nvidia GPU or to the rest of the NVLink ecosystem, and that’s happening at the racks and scale-up infrastructure,” said Buck.

## **Smarter Power for Accelerated Computing**

As AI factories scale, energy is becoming the new bottleneck. The
[NVIDIA Domain Power Service (DPS)](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/collections/dps)
flips that constraint into an opportunity — turning power into a dynamic, orchestrated resource. Running as a Kubernetes service, DPS models and manages energy use across the data center, from rack to room to facility. It enables operators to extract more performance per megawatt by constraining power intelligently, improving throughput without expanding infrastructure.

DPS integrates tightly with the
[NVIDIA Omniverse DSX Blueprint](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/omniverse-dsx-blueprint/)
, a platform for designing and operating next-generation data centers. It works alongside technologies like Power Reservation Steering to balance workloads across the facility and the Workload Power Profile Solution to tune GPU power to the needs of specific jobs. Together, they form DSX Boost — an energy-aware control layer that maximizes efficiency while meeting performance targets.

DPS also extends beyond the data center. With grid-facing APIs, it supports automated load shedding and demand response, helping utilities stabilize the grid during peak events. The result is a resilient, grid-interactive AI factory that turns every watt into measurable progress.
