Today,
[Veo](https://deepmind.google/models/veo/)
is getting more expressive, with improvements that help you create more fun, creative, high-quality videos based on ingredient images, built directly for the mobile format. We’re excited to bring new creative possibilities for everyone from casual storytellers to professional filmmakers.

We’re releasing:

1. **Improvements to Veo 3.1 Ingredients to Video,**
   our capability that lets you create videos based on reference images. This update makes videos more expressive and creative, even with simple prompts
2. **Native vertical outputs for Ingredients to Video (portrait mode)**
   to power mobile-first, short-form video creation
3. **State-of-the-art upscaling to 1080p and 4K resolution**
   for high-fidelity production workflows

Whether you are looking for livelier movement, better control over visual elements or broadcast-ready resolution, these updates give you the tools to bring your vision to life. These updates are launching in the Gemini app, YouTube, Flow, Google Vids, the Gemini API and Vertex AI.
