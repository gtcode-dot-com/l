AgentCore Gateway now supports API GatewayAs organizations explore the possibilities of agentic applications, they continue to navigate challenges of using enterprise data as context in invocation requests to large language models (LLMs) in a manner that is secure and aligned with enterprise policies. To help standardize and secure those interactions, many organizations are using the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)
(MCP) specification, which defines how agentic applications can securely connect to data sources and tools.

While MCP has been advantageous for net new use cases, organizations also navigate challenges with bringing their existing API estate into the agentic era. MCP can certainly wrap existing APIs, but it requires additional work, translating requests from MCP to RESTful APIs, making sure security is maintained through the entire request flow, and applying the standard observability required for production deployments.

[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway.html)
now supports
[Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
as a target, translating MCP requests to AgentCore Gateway into RESTful requests to API Gateway. You can now expose both new and existing API endpoints to agentic applications using MCP, with built-in security and observability. This post covers these new capabilities and shows how to implement them.

## What’s new: API Gateway support in AgentCore Gateway

AgentCore Gateway now supports API Gateway targets in addition to
[existing target types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-supported-targets.html)
(
[Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
functions,
[OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)
schemas,
[Smithy](https://smithy.io/)
models, and
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro)
servers).

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/04/ML-20114-image-1.png)

Our customers have successfully built extensive API ecosystems using API Gateway, connecting backends across numerous applications. As enterprises advance toward next-generation agentic applications, the natural evolution is to expose these existing APIs and backend tools to AI-powered systems, enabling seamless integration between established infrastructure and modern intelligent agents.

This integration between AgentCore Gateway and API Gateway simplifies the connection between API Gateway and AgentCore Gateway. It allows you to directly target API Gateway, so that you don’t need to export API Gateway APIs as an OpenAPI 3 specification and then add it to AgentCore Gateway as an OpenAPI target.

With this integration, a new API\_GATEWAY target type will be added to AgentCore Gateway, eliminating the manual export/import process. REST API owners can add their API as an AgentCore Gateway target with a few console interactions or a single CLI command to expose their existing REST API as MCP tools using AgentCore Gateway. API consumers can then connect AI agents with these REST APIs through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and power their workflows with AI integration. Your agentic applications can now connect to your new or existing API Gateway API. This integration between AgentCore Gateway and API Gateway supports IAM and API key authorization.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/04/ML-20114-image-2.png)

Both AgentCore Gateway and API Gateway have integrations with
[Amazon CloudWatch Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-logging.html)
,
[AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/cloudtrail.html)
, and
[AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-enabling-xray.html)
for observability. Agent developers using this new capability between AgentCore Gateway and API Gateway can use these observability tools.

## Walkthrough

This post shows you how to set up an existing REST API with API Gateway as a target for AgentCore Gateway. With this integration you can use your existing REST APIs as a tool for your agentic applications exposed using AgentCore Gateway.

### Prerequisites

For this example, you need the following:

* An AWS account with an existing REST API in API Gateway.
* An
  [Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
  (IAM) role or user with enough permissions to create an AgentCore Gateway and set up an API Gateway target.

You can create gateways and add targets in multiple ways:

This post uses Boto3 for setting up the integration between AgentCore Gateway and API Gateway. For an interactive walkthrough, you can use the Jupyter Notebook sample on
[GitHub](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples/tree/main/01-tutorials/02-AgentCore-gateway/11-api-gateway-as-a-target)
.

### Set up prerequisites for inbound and outbound authorization.

Inbound authorization authenticates incoming user requests. Outbound authorization helps AgentCore Gateway to securely connect to gateway targets, such as an API Gateway, on behalf of the authenticated user.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/04/ML-20114-image-3.png)

For API Gateway as a target, AgentCore Gateway supports the following types of outbound authorization:

* **No authorization (not recommended)**
  – Some target types provide you the option to bypass outbound authorization. We do not recommend this less secure option.
* **IAM-based outbound authorization**
  – Use the
  [gateway service role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-prerequisites-permissions.html#gateway-service-role-permissions)
  to authorize access to the gateway target with
  [AWS Signature Version 4 (Sig V4)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html)
  .
* **API key**
  – Use the API key, which is set up using AgentCore Identity to authorize access to API Gateway target. API keys created using an API Gateway mapped with API Gateway usage plans, helps you monitor and control API usage. Please refer to this
  [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html)
  for more details.

[Create an IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html)
with the trust policy from the
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-prerequisites-permissions.html#gateway-service-role-permissions)
.

* For Outbound Authorization with IAM-based authorization, the policy should include
  `execute-api:Invoke`
  permission. Sample inline policy:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "execute-api:Invoke",
            ],
            "Resource": " "arn:aws:execute-api:{AWS_Region}:{AWS_Account_ID}:api-id/stage/METHOD_HTTP_VERB/resource-path",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

Once done, update the policy as described in the AgentCore Gateway
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-outbound-auth.html#gateway-outbound-auth-api-key)
.

### Create an AgentCore Gateway

When using the AgentCore starter toolkit, you can create a gateway
[with a default authorization configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/gateway-inbound-auth.html#gateway-inbound-auth-jwt)
using
[Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/)
for JWT-based inbound authorization.

```
import boto3
gateway_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
auth_config = {
    "customJWTAuthorizer": {
        "allowedClients": ['<cognito_client_id>'],  # Client MUST match with the ClientId configured in Cognito. Example: 7rfbikfsm51j2fpaggacgng84g
        "discoveryUrl": <cognito_oauth_discovery_url>
    }
}
create_response = gateway_client.create_gateway(
name='sample-ac-gateway',
    	roleArn='<IAM_Role_ARN>', # The IAM Role must have permissions to create/list/get/delete Gateway
    protocolType='MCP',
    protocolConfiguration={
        'mcp': {
            'supportedVersions': ['2025-03-26'],
            'searchType': 'SEMANTIC'
        }
    },
    authorizerType='CUSTOM_JWT',
    authorizerConfiguration=auth_config,
    description='AgentCore Gateway with API Gateway target'
)
print(create_response)
# Retrieve the GatewayID used for GatewayTarget creation
gatewayID = create_response["gatewayId"]
gatewayURL = create_response["gatewayUrl"]
print(gatewayID)
```

This returns
`GATEWAY_ID`
that you will need to create the gateway target.

### Create an AgentCore Gateway target

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/04/ML-20114-image-4.png)

### Create a target configuration

To create an API gateway target, you need to specify the following as the part of target configuration:

* **toolFilters**
  : Use this to determine what resources on the REST API will be exposed as tool on the gateway. Filters also support wildcards in the filterPath.
* **toolOverrides**
  (optional): Use this to allow users to override tool names and description. You must specify explicit paths and methods.
* **restApiId**
  : Use this to pass API Gateway ID.

Below are a few examples of target configurations:

**Example 1**

This exposes
**GET & POST /pets**
,
**GET /pets/{petId}**
to the gateway and overrides their tool names and descriptions.

```
{
  "mcp": {
    "apiGateway": {
      "restApiId": "<api-id>",
      "stage": "<stage>",
      "apiGatewayToolConfiguration": {
        "toolFilters": [
          {
            "filterPath": "/pets",
            "methods": ["GET","POST"]
          },
          {
            "filterPath": "/pets/{petId}",
            "methods": ["GET"]
          }
        ],
	  "toolOverrides" : [
          {
             "name": "ListPets",
             "path": "/pets",
             "method": "GET",
             "description":"Retrieves all the available Pets."
         },
         {
              "name": "AddPet",
              "path": "/pets",
              "method": "POST",
               "description":"Add a new pet to the available Pets."
          },
          {
             "path": "/pets/{petId}",
             "method": "GET",
             "name": "GetPetById",
             "description": "Retrieve a specific pet by its ID"
         }
         ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example 2**

This will expose
**GET /pets**
but also
**GET /pets/{petId}**
or anything under
**/pets**
. Since
**toolOverrides**
is not specified, it will use the resource description from API Gateway.

```
{
  "mcp": {
    "apiGateway": {
      "restApiId": "<api-id>",
      "stage": "<stage>",
      "apiGatewayToolConfiguration": {
        "toolFilters": [
          {
            "filterPath": "/pets/*",
            "methods": ["GET"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Credential provider configuration

When creating a target, you also need to specify the target’s outbound authorization using a credential provider configuration. As discussed above, there are three types of credential providers:

**GATEWAY\_IAM\_ROLE**

This uses the
`ROLE_ARN`
you specified when creating the gateway. Define the credential provider configuration as follows:

```
[
    {
        "credentialProviderType": "GATEWAY_IAM_ROLE"
    }
]
```

**API\_KEY**

This requires the
[creation of an API key credential provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/identity-add-api-key.html)
with AgentCore Identity.

```
[
    {
        "credentialProviderType": "API_KEY",
        "credentialProvider": {
            "apiKeyCredentialProvider": {
                "providerArn": "<provider-arn>",
                "credentialParameterName": "x-api-key", // optional
                "credentialPrefix": "abc",              // optional, prefix is added to the API key when sending it to the target endpoint
                "credentialLocation": "HEADER"          //optional, specifies where in the request the API key should be placed
            }
        }
    }
]
```

**NO\_AUTH**

`NO_AUTH`
can be configured by not specifying a credential provider configuration while creating the AgentCore Gateway target. This is not recommended.

### Create an AgentCore Gateway target

Now configure your REST API as a gateway target:

```
import boto3
gateway_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
create_gateway_target_response = gateway_client.create_gateway_target(
    name='api-gateway-target',
    gatewayIdentifier='<gateway_ID>',
    targetConfiguration=[< your_target_configuration>],
    credentialProviderConfigurations=[<your_credential_config>]
)
print(create_gateway_target_response)
gateway_target_id=create_gateway_target_2_response['targetId']
```

### Test gateway with the Strands Agent framework

Test the gateway with the
[Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/)
framework to list and call the available tools from MCP server. You can also use other MCP-compatible agents built with different agentic frameworks.

```
def create_streamable_http_transport():
    return streamablehttp_client(
        gatewayURL, headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {<Bearer_Token>}"}
    )
client = MCPClient(create_streamable_http_transport)
with client:
    # Call the listTools
    tools = client.list_tools_sync()
    # Create an Agent with the model and tools
    agent = Agent(model=yourModel, tools=tools)  ## you can replace with any model you like
    # Invoke the agent with the sample prompt. This will only invoke MCP listTools and retrieve the list of tools the LLM has access to. The below does not actually call any tool.
    agent("Hi, can you list all tools available to you")
    # Tool calling
    agent("List all the available pets")
    agent("Tell me about the pet with petId 3 ")
    agent("When my order will be delivered? My order id is 2")
```

You will observe the following output:

```
I have access to the following tools:
1. **x_amz_bedrock_agentcore_search** - A search tool that returns a trimmed down list of tools based on a provided context/query
2. **api-gateway-target-1___Add_Pet** - Add a new pet to the available Pets
3. **api-gateway-target-1___GetPetById** - Retrieve a specific pet by its ID (requires petId parameter)
4. **api-gateway-target-1___List_Pets** - Retrieves all the available Pets (optional parameters: page, type)
5. **api-gateway-target-2___GetOrderById** - Retrieve a specific order by its ID (requires orderId parameter)
I'll retrieve all the available pets for you.
Tool #1: api-gateway-target-1___List_Pets
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Here are all the available pets:
1. **Pet ID 1** - Dog - $249.99
2. **Pet ID 2** - Cat - $124.99
3. **Pet ID 3** - Fish - $0.99
I'll retrieve the details for pet ID 3.
Tool #2: api-gateway-target-1___GetPetById
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Here are the details for pet ID 3:
- **Pet ID**: 3
- **Type**: Fish
- **Price**: $0.99
I'll check the details of your order with ID 2 to see the delivery information.
Tool #3: api-gateway-target-2___GetOrderById
"HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Based on your order details:
- **Order ID**: 2
- **Pet Category**: Cat
- **Price**: $124.99
- **Delivery Date**: 02-12-2025 (December 2nd, 2025)
Your cat order will be delivered on **December 2nd, 2025**.
```

## Observability

[Enable application logs and tracing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html#observability-configure-cloudwatch-console)
for your AgentCore Gateway resource. You will see detailed logs to help monitor and troubleshoot your AgentCore Gateway resource. It will include the tool calls performed by your agentic application, request parameters, responses, and errors if any.

**Example logs:**

```
{
    "resource_arn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2:<AWS_Account_Id>:gateway/sample-ac-gateway2-mgtqozexct",
    "event_timestamp": 1763621922275,
    "body": {
        "isError": false,
        "log": "Executing tool api-gateway-target-1___GetPetById from target W8BCF5VEAZ",
        "id": "3"
    },
    "account_id": "<AWS_Account_Id>",
    "request_id": "8a70f423-79ee-4168-9d68-b76ad3*****",
    "trace_id": "324a2ecc08631a55a02bb8f74104****",
    "span_id": "f58914982450ad9b",
    "timestamp": "1763621922275",
    "gateway_id": "sample-ac-gateway2-mgtqozexct"
}
{
    "resource_arn": "arn:aws:bedrock-agentcore:us-west-2: <AWS_Account_Id>:gateway/sample-ac-gateway2-mgtqozexct",
    "event_timestamp": 1763621922348,
    "body": {
        "isError": false,
        "responseBody": "{jsonrpc=2.0, id=3, result={isError=false, content=[{type=text, text={\"id\":3,\"type\":\"fish\",\"price\":0.99}}]}}",
        "log": "Successfully processed request",
        "id": "3"
    },
    "account_id": "<AWS_Account_Id>",
    "request_id": "8a70f423-79ee-4168-9d68-b76ad3ef****",
    "trace_id": "324a2ecc08631a55a02bb8f7410****",
    "span_id": "f58914982450ad9b",
    "timestamp": "1763621922348",
    "gateway_id": "sample-ac-gateway2-mgtqozexct"
}
```

Along with this, AgentCore Gateway offers detailed CloudWatch metrics including the
**usage metrics**
(TargetType, IngressAuthType, EgressAuthType, RequestsPerSession),
**invocation metrics**
(Invocations, ConcurrentExecutions, Sessions),
**performance metrics**
(Latency, Duration, TargetExecutionTime), and
**error rates**
(Throttles, SystemErrors, UserErrors).

AgentCore Gateway also supports
[AWS X-Ray](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-services-agentcore.html)
and OTEL conformant vended spans that customers can use to track invocations across different primitives that are being used.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2025/12/04/ML-20114-image-6.png)

[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-gateway-metrics.html#observability-gateway-vended-spans)
.

## Clean up

To avoid recurring charges, make sure to delete the resources created by running the following code.

```
import boto3
gateway_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
# Deleting the Gateway
Targetresponse = gateway_client.delete_gateway_target( gatewayIdentifier='<Gateway_Id>', targetId='<Target_Id>')print(response)
# Deleting the Gateway
response = gateway_client.delete_gateway(
gatewayIdentifier='<Gateway_Id>')
print(response)
```

## Conclusion

AgentCore Gateway now supports Amazon API Gateway as a target, exposing REST APIs as MCP-compatible endpoints. You can bring your existing API infrastructure to agentic use cases while using your current security and observability tools.
