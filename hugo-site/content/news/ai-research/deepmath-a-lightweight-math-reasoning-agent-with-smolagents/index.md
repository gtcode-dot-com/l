# DeepMath: A lightweight math reasoning Agent with smolagents

![An LLM is using a calculator to answer questions.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/intel-deepmath/deepmath-figure.jpg)

*By Intel AI Software Group*

[DeepMath](https://huggingface.co/Intel/deepmath-v1)
is an aligned math reasoning agent built on
**[Qwen3-4B Thinking](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507)**
and fine-tuned with
**GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)**
. Instead of verbose text, the model emits
**tiny Python snippets**
for intermediate steps, runs them in a secure sandbox, and folds the results back into its reasoning, reducing errors and output length. The agent is implemented using the
**[smolagents library](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents)**
.

We evaluate DeepMath on four math datasets:
**[MATH500](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceH4/MATH-500)
,
[AIME](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opencompass/AIME2025)
,
[HMMT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MathArena/hmmt_feb_2025)
, and
[HLE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cais/hle)
,**
and show that:

* 🤖 The math agent alone reduces output lengths by up to 66%, while often improving accuracy.
* ⚡ GRPO training improves the agent performance even further, in almost all benchmarks.

## Why DeepMath?

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced reasoning capabilities, but mathematical problem-solving remains challenging; chain-of-thought traces can be lengthy and prone to arithmetic mistakes. Recent works[^1][^2] demonstrate that small models can reach strong performance, and other studies[^3] investigate tool use to improve reliability. What those papers generally do not emphasize is reducing trace verbosity or explicitly training models to prefer short, computation-oriented traces executed in a constrained, auditable environment.

We focused on two goals:

1. **Offload deterministic computation**
   to a safe executor.
2. **Train models to prefer concise, computation-oriented traces**
   over verbose text.

**DeepMath**
tackles this by combining a small Python executor with a fine-tuned LLM, enabling concise, computation-driven reasoning. The model learns to generate short Python snippets, which are executed in a sandbox and reintegrated into the context. GRPO fine-tuning encourages this behavior by rewarding correctness and encouraging shorter outputs.

## How It Works

* Base model:
  [Qwen3-4B Thinking](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507)
  .
* Executor constraints: sandboxed environment, allow-list of imported modules, per-snippet timeout.
* Inference: based on
  [smolagents](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/)
  , a math agent was created.
  [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vLLM)
  is used as the inference engine.
* Training: based on the GRPO trainer in
  [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl)
  , we modified TRL's vLLM client and server to generate GRPO completions using our DeepMath agent.

![Changes to vLLM client and server in TRL library.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/intel-deepmath/trl-grpo-vllm-deepmath.png)

*Figure 1: The vLLM client and server were modified to use the DeepMath agent in generating the candidates, while using the vLLM backend.*

* **Agent Interface:**
  During inference, the model can output normal tokens or special agent calls containing Python snippets.
* **Execution:**
  Snippets run in a sandboxed environment with strict safety constraints (no file I/O, no network, timeouts).
* **Design Goals:**

  + **Concision:**
    Replace multi-line textual calculations with short, focused snippets.
  + **Determinism & Safety:**
    Enforce strict execution limits.
  + **Interpretability:**
    Snippets are readable and auditable.

## Training with GRPO

We fine-tune the model using
**GRPO**
, a reward-based optimization that balances:

* **Accuracy Reward:**
  +1 for correct answers.
* **Using code snippets:**
  +1 for generating code snippets, weighted 10:1 vs. the accuracy reward.
* **Length reduction:**
  shorter lengths are encouraged by limiting the GRPO completion candidates to 5k tokens.
* **Temperature Scheduling:**
  We implemented linear temperature scheduling (T=1.2 → T=0.7) to balance exploration and stability during training. This approach aims to enhance experimentation during the initial training phases, subsequently reducing the temperature as we refine our proficiency in the skill.
* **In-context Learning**
  : we include 4 solved examples where the trace contains agent calls and executor outputs, so the model learns the syntax and the call/response pattern.
* **Dataset**
  : we used the Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) subset of the
  [OpenMathReasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning)
  dataset. Note that GRPO only uses the
  problem
  , not the solution in the data. This dataset was chosen to ensure the problems benefit from the external tool.

## Evaluation

We benchmarked DeepMath against baselines on four datasets. Metrics include:

* **majority@16**
  : robustness across samples, as used in previous math reasoning works, see references.
* **Mean output length**
  : brevity.

![Main results table.](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/intel-deepmath/main-results.png)

* We compare a baseline configuration (
  [Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507)
  , no agenting) with our DeepMath model. As ablation, we evaluate the agentic framework we developed running with the untrained Qwen3 model, denoted by
  **+Agent**
  . Additionally, we examine whether the GRPO training (for agentic use) improves non-agentic inference, denoted by
  **+GRPO**
  . Thus the two ablations are independent, not additive.
* We observe the agentic inference reduces output lengths, with mixed accuracy results. The DeepMath model is both GRPO-trained and run in agentic mode, and shows the highest accuracy with shortened traces. We conclude
  **both GRPO training and agentic inference are needed**
  for best results.

**Key Insight:**
DeepMath reduces output length by up to
**66%**
while improving accuracy on challenging datasets.

## Why It Matters

* **Accuracy:**
  Offloading computation reduces arithmetic errors.
* **Efficiency:**
  Shorter outputs mean faster inference and easier interpretability.
* **Safety:**
  Sandbox execution mitigates risks of running arbitrary code.

## Conclusion

DeepMath demonstrates a practical and lightweight way to combine a small executor with an LLM and to train the model to prefer short, computation-driven traces. Offloading deterministic computation reduces arithmetic and numerical errors and shortens traces, and GRPO fine-tuning further encourages concise, correct answers. The result is a more accurate and more interpretable math-solving agent without requiring a massive model or heavyweight external tools.

## Limitations & Future Work

* **Scope**
  : we focused on a small model and on mathematical reasoning.
* **Generalization**
  : evaluated on contest-style math; results may not transfer to open-ended mathematical creativity or formal proofs.
* Executing generated code is inherently risky. DeepMath uses strict sandboxing and resource limits, but any deployment should carefully manage attack surfaces and enforce rate limits.
