The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at MIT has awarded funding to eight new research studies to understand how artificial intelligence innovations can be used in the fight against poverty through its new
[Project AI Evidence](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative/partnership-ai-evidence-paie)
.

The age of AI has brought wide-ranging optimism and skepticism about its effects on society. To realize AI’s full potential, Project AI Evidence (PAIE) will identify which AI solutions work and for whom, and scale only the most effective, inclusive, and responsible solutions — while scaling down those that may potentially cause harm.

PAIE will generate evidence on what works by connecting governments, tech companies, and nonprofits with world-class economists at MIT and across J-PAL’s global network to evaluate and improve AI solutions to entrenched social challenges.

The new initiative is prioritizing questions policymakers are already asking: Do AI-assisted teaching tools help all children learn? How can early-warning flood systems help people affected by natural disasters? Can machine learning algorithms help reduce deforestation in the Amazon? Can AI-powered chatbots help improve people’s health? In the coming years, PAIE will run a series of funding competitions to invite proposals for evaluations of AI tools that address questions like these, and many more.

PAIE is financially supported by a grant from Google.org, philanthropic support from Community Jameel, a grant from Canada’s International Development Research Centre and UK International Development, and a collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services. Through a grant from Eric and Wendy Schmidt, awarded by recommendation of Schmidt Sciences, the initiative will also study generative AI in the workplace, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Alex Diaz, head of AI for social good at Google.org, says, “we’re thrilled to collaborate with MIT and J-PAL, already leaders in this space, on Project AI Evidence. AI has great potential to benefit all people, but we urgently need to study what works, what doesn’t, and why, if we are to realize this potential.”

“Artificial intelligence holds extraordinary potential, but only if the tools, knowledge, and power to shape it are accessible to all — that includes contextually grounded research and evidence on what works and what does not,” adds Maggie Gorman-Velez, vice president of strategy, regions, and policies at IDRC. “That is why IDRC is proud to be supporting this new evaluation work as part of our ongoing commitment to the responsible scaling of proven safe, inclusive, and locally relevant AI innovations.”

J-PAL is uniquely positioned to help understand AI’s effects on society: Since its inception in 2003, J-PAL’s network of researchers has led over 2,500 rigorous evaluations of social policies and programs around the world. Through PAIE, J-PAL will bring together leading experts in AI technology, research, and social policy, in alignment with MIT president Sally Kornbluth’s focus on generative AI as a

PAIE is chaired by Professor

[Iqbal Dhaliwal](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/person/dhaliwal)

**New evaluations of urgent policy questions**

The studies funded in PAIE’s first round of competition explore urgent questions in key sectors like education, health, climate, and economic opportunity.

**How can AI be most effective in classrooms, helping both students and teachers?**

Existing
[research](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/policy-insight/tailoring-instruction-students-learning-levels-increase-learning)
shows that personalized learning is important for students, but challenging to implement with limited resources. In Kenya, education social enterprise EIDU has developed an AI tool that helps teachers identify learning gaps and adapt their daily lesson plans. In India, the nongovernmental organization (NGO) Pratham is developing an AI tool to increase the impact and scale of the evidence-informed
[Teaching at the Right Level](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/teaching-right-level-improve-learning)
approach. J-PAL researchers Daron Acemoglu, Iqbal Dhaliwal, and Francisco Gallego will work with both organizations to study the effects and potential of these different use cases on
[teachers’ productivity and students’ learning](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/ai-powered-structured-pedagogy-programs-impact-student-learning-and-teacher)
.

**Can AI tools reduce gender bias in schools?**

Researchers are collaborating with Italy’s Ministry of Education to evaluate whether AI tools can help
[close gender gaps in students’ performance](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/ai-powered-structured-pedagogy-programs-impact-student-learning-and-teacher)
by addressing teachers’ unconscious biases. J-PAL affiliates Michela Carlana and Will Dobbie, along with Francesca Miserocchi and Eleonora Patacchini, will study the impacts of two AI tools, one that helps teachers predict performance and a second that gives real-time feedback on the diversity of their decisions.

**Can AI help career counselors uncover more job opportunities?**

In Kenya, researchers are evaluating if an AI tool can
[identify overlooked skills and unlock employment opportunities](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/initiative-project/learning-recommend-ai-human-counselors-and-job-matching-kenya)
, particularly for youth, women, and those without formal education. In collaboration with NGOs Swahilipot and Tabiya, Jasmin Baier and J-PAL researcher Christian Meyer will evaluate how the tool changes people’s job search strategies and employment. This study will shed light on AI as a complement, rather than a substitute, for human expertise in career guidance.

**Looking forward**

As use of AI in the social sector evolves, these evaluations are a first step in discovering effective, responsible solutions that will go the furthest in alleviating poverty and inequality.

J-PAL’s Dhaliwal notes, “J-PAL has a long history of evaluating innovative technology and its ability to improve people’s lives. While AI has incredible potential, we need to maximize its benefits and minimize possible harms. We’re grateful to our donors, sponsors, and collaborators for their catalytic support in launching PAIE, which will help us do exactly that by continuing to expand evidence on the impacts of AI innovations.”

J-PAL is also seeking new collaborators who share its vision of discovering and scaling up real-world AI solutions. It aims to support more governments and social sector organizations that want to adopt AI responsibly, and will continue to expand funding for new evaluations and provide policy guidance based on the latest research.
