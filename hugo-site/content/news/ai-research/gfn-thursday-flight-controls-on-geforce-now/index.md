The wait is over, pilots.
[Flight control support](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5787/)
— one of the most community-requested features for
[GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)
— is live starting today, following its
[announcement](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-ces-2026-recap)
at CES earlier this month.

Virtual captains can now bring dedicated flight gear into the cloud and feel every roll, yaw and throttle change with even more precision, starting with the
[Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS One](https://www.thrustmaster.com/en-us/products/t-flight-hotas-one/)
.

Remember to enter the giveaway for a chance to score a T.Flight Hotas One MSFS Edition and one month of a GeForce NOW Ultimate membership — follow Thrustmaster and GeForce NOW, and repost the giveaway post to enter before Saturday, Jan. 24.

Also on the horizon,
*Delta Force*
from Team Jade (TiMi Studio Group) is coming soon to GeForce NOW, adding another big-name title to the cloud lineup. Get ready for all the action by streaming the four new games in this cloud this week.

## **Pilots Wanted**

Members can now jump into their favorite flight and space simulation games with a full stick-and-throttle setup streamed right from the cloud. It’s all about dialing in that authentic, hands-on flying experience while keeping latency low and gameplay responsive on GeForce NOW.

*Full throttle in the cloud.*

To get right to flying, members can look for a dedicated row in the GeForce NOW app highlighting games that support flight controls, making it simple to spot great titles for putting their new setup through its paces.

This initial flight control support rollout is just the beginning, with plans to keep tuning the experience and expand compatibility to more
[peripherals](https://preview.nvidia.com/en-zz/geforce-now/system-reqs/#windows-pc)
. Fire up the rig, plug in the Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS One and get ready to take off — the cloud cockpit is open and ready for flight.

## **Your Next Mission: ‘Delta Force’**

Team Jade’s
*Delta Force*
is coming soon to the cloud, ready to drop players into high-stakes extraction with an all-out warfare mode where coordination and precision matter just as much as raw firepower. When it launches on GeForce NOW, members will be able to jump into the action instantly from almost any device, taking advantage of high‑performance streaming to stay locked at smooth frame rates even in the most chaotic firefights.

*Get ready to squad up, Delta Force is inbound soon.*

On GeForce NOW, every long‑range shot, helicopter insertion and tense objective push can feel crisp and responsive, whether playing on low‑powered laptops, Macs or mobile devices. The cloud makes it easy to squad up, drop in and get straight to the mission without worrying about downloads, patches or local hardware.

## **New in the Cloud**

![MIO on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-MIO_Memories_In_Orbit-1680x840.jpg)


*A graceful little robot having the worst day in the universe.*

*MIO: Memories in Orbit*
is a neon-tinged metroidvania about a nimble little robot waking up on a massive, overgrown ark called the Vessel with nothing but fractured memories and a whole lot of trouble coming its way. Dart through low-gravity corridors, chain together elegant wall-runs, glides and grapples, and tangle with rogue machines as the Vessel itself quietly steals the spotlight — moody, decaying and just alive enough to keep a few secrets.

In addition, members can look for the following:
