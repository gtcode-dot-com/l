Today, we're expanding the Gemini 3 model family with the release of Gemini 3 Flash, which offers frontier intelligence built for speed at a fraction of the cost. With this release, we’re making Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence accessible to everyone across Google products.

Last month, we kicked off Gemini 3 with
[Gemini 3 Pro](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#note-from-ceo)
and
[Gemini 3 Deep Think](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-deep-think/)
mode, and the response has been incredible. Since launch day, we have been processing over 1T tokens per day on our API. We’ve seen you use Gemini 3 to

to learn about complex topics, build and design

and understand all types of

.

With Gemini 3, we introduced frontier performance across complex reasoning,
[multimodal and vision understanding](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-3-pro-vision/)
and agentic and vibe coding tasks. Gemini 3 Flash retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost. It not only enables everyday tasks with improved reasoning, but also is our most impressive model for agentic workflows.

Starting today, Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out to millions of people globally:
