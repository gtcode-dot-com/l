TR developed Open Arena using AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions. It uses Amazon Bedrock for foundational model interactions, supporting simple chat and complex Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. Open Arena uses Amazon Bedrock Flows as the custom workflow builder where users can drag-and-drop components like prompts, agents, knowledge bases and Lambda functions to create sophisticated AI workflows without coding. The system also integrates with AWS OpenSearch for knowledge bases and external APIs for advanced agent capabilities.

For data separation, orchestration is managed using the Enterprise AI Platform AWS account, capturing operational data. Flow instances and user-specific data reside in the user’s dedicated AWS account, stored in a database. Each user’s data and workflow executions are isolated within their respective AWS accounts, which is required for complying with Thomson Reuters data sovereignty and enterprise security policies with strict regional controls. The system integrates with Thomson Reuters SSO solution to automatically identify users and grant secure, private access to foundational models.

The orchestration layer, centrally hosted within the Enterprise AI Platform AWS account, manages AI workflow activities, including scheduling, deployment, resource provisioning, and governance across user environments.

The system features fully automated provisioning of  Amazon Bedrock Flows directly within each user’s AWS account, avoiding manual setup and accelerating time to value. Using AWS Lambda for serverless compute and DynamoDB for scalable, low-latency storage, the system dynamically allocates resources based on real-time demand. This architecture makes sure prompt flows and supporting infrastructure are deployed and scaled to match workload fluctuations, optimizing performance, cost, and user experience.

> *“Our decision to adopt a cross-account architecture was driven by a commitment to enterprise security and operational excellence. By isolating orchestration from execution, we make sure that each user’s data remains private and secure within their own AWS account, while still delivering a seamless, centrally-managed experience. This design empowers organizations to innovate rapidly without compromising compliance or control.”*
