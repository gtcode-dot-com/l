# Code, Compute and Connection: Inside the Inaugural NVIDIA AI Day São Paulo

*Editor’s note: This post is part of a blog series highlighting*
[*NVIDIA AI Days*](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/ai-days/)
*across the globe.*

The worldwide tour of NVIDIA AI Days — bringing together AI enthusiasts, developers, researchers and startups — made its latest stop in São Paulo, Brazil.

More than 500 attendees joined NVIDIA AI Day São Paulo in January to learn about
[sovereign AI](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-sovereign-ai/)
— including breakout sessions on AI agents and open models.

“NVIDIA solutions are fundamental to all the technologies we develop,” said Paulo Perez, cofounder and CEO of biotechnology startup Biofy. “DNA is composed of a gigantic amount of data, which we call nucleotides. Analyzing this data takes a long time when done using traditional methods with CPUs. In this regard, NVIDIA’s GPUs, algorithms and frameworks accelerate the results we are capable of delivering by hundreds of times.”

## Why It Matters

The latest AI trends in Brazil showcase how the technology is driving advancements in Latin America and beyond.

The
[Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Plan for 2024-2028](https://www.gov.br/g20/en/news/brasil-launches-a-usd-4-billion-plan-for-ai-and-prepares-global-action)
, called “AI for the Good of All,” outlines 50+ targeted initiatives across public services, R&D, infrastructure, industry and government.

The Brazil government plans to invest about $4 billion through 2028, focused on promoting infrastructure for AI development, dissemination, training and professional qualification; improving public services; fostering business innovation; and enhancing regulatory and governance processes in the sector.

Leading startups in the region are developing breakthrough applications in financial services, healthcare, retail, agriculture and manufacturing — with top universities in Brazil allocating high-performance computing infrastructure to the students and researchers who will fuel the future of AI in the nation.

The numbers help showcase Brazil’s expanding AI ecosystem:

## Event Highlights

In addition to four
[NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/training/)
technical labs, the event featured sessions on the fundamentals to AI agent creation as well as large language model (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation labs focused on accelerated linguistic diversity.

An all-conference plenary session hosted by the
[NVIDIA Inception](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/startups/)
program for startups featured Howard Wright, vice president of startups ecosystem at NVIDIA, who discussed how sovereign AI empowers Brazil to unlock national potential, fostering economic growth, technological autonomy and leadership in the regional AI landscape.

Another all-conference panel, called “Sovereign AI in Action: Learnings and Partnerships Driving Local Innovation,” explored how startups, academia and AI hubs across Latin America are crafting partnerships and nurturing specialized talent to bolster AI innovation, including using NVIDIA NeMo software and NVIDIA NIM microservices.

## Industry in Motion

Brazil-based NVIDIA partners are helping fuel the AI industrial revolution.

At the event:

* Amadeus AI showcased advanced techniques in efficiently fine‑tuning LLMs for specific domains and languages, including using reinforcement learning with human feedback. The company emphasized cost‑effective fine‑tuning pipelines using GPUs and open source tools to balance performance and scalability.
* Langflow shared architecture patterns, best practices for evaluation and governance, and methods of combining Langflow with NVIDIA technologies to build robust, cost‑efficient agents aligned with business goals.​
* WideLabs presented how Latin American governments and enterprises are building sovereign AI platforms, ranging from national dataset initiatives to applications with stringent safety and governance requirements, all built on the NVIDIA AI stack. The company also presented its new AI synthetic data pipeline, Nemotron Personas Brazil.

“At NVIDIA AI Days, we were able to gain a much more thorough understanding of the NVIDIA NeMo framework,” said Rodrigo Malossi, cofounder and chief technology officer of WideLabs. “The event also allowed us to better understand NVIDIA’s new initiatives and what they are proposing with respect to large-scale, national-level sovereign AI efforts.”

## What’s Next

The NVIDIA developer ecosystem in the region will continue driving innovation in support of the Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Plan, with a focus on LLM development, healthcare and financial services.

In addition, NVIDIA is partnering with Brazil-founded telecommunications provider Claro — the first NVIDIA Cloud Partner in Latin America — to accelerate sovereign AI in the region.
