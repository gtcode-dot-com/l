# How an Agent Built a 3D Paris Gallery by Chaining Two Hugging Face Spaces

*An agent built a 3D Paris gallery from two Hugging Face Spaces.*

I asked a coding agent to build a beautiful website showcasing the monuments of
Paris as 3D Gaussian splats. I never opened an image generator. I never touched a
3D reconstruction tool. The agent produced every asset (the images
**and**
the 3D
splats) by calling two Hugging Face Spaces directly, then wired them into a
cinematic viewer.

Here's the result, live as a static Space:

This post is about
*how*
that's possible now, and why I think it's a preview of
how a lot of multimedia software gets built from here on.

## The building-block economy comes for multimedia

Mitchell Hashimoto recently described a shift he calls the
[building block economy](https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-block-economy)
:
the most effective path to software is no longer a polished monolith, but small,
well-documented components that others (increasingly
*agents*
) can assemble.
His key observation: AI is okay at building everything from scratch, but it is
**really good at gluing together**
proven pieces.

That thesis has mostly been told with
*code*
libraries. But the same forces are
hitting
**multimedia AI**
. The hard part of using a state-of-the-art image model,
a video model, a TTS model, or a 3D reconstruction model was never the model. It
was the integration: SDKs, weights, GPUs, input formats, polling. If each model
were instead a documented, callable block, an agent could glue them together the
same way it globs together npm packages.

That's exactly what Hugging Face Spaces have quietly become.

## Every Space is a building block, via `agents.md`

The Hub hosts thousands of state-of-the-art models (a huge share of them
**open-weights**
), and most are deployed as interactive
**Spaces**
. As of now,
every Gradio Space also exposes a plain-text
[`agents.md`](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/spaces-agents)
that tells an agent
*exactly*
how to call it:

```
curl https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSplat/agents.md
```

returns everything needed in one shot: the schema URL, the call and poll templates,
how to upload files, and the auth hint:

```
API schema:   GET  .../gradio_api/info
Call endpoint: POST .../gradio_api/call/v2/{endpoint} {"param_name": value, ...}
Poll result:  GET  .../gradio_api/call/{endpoint}/{event_id}
File inputs:  POST .../gradio_api/upload -F "files=@file.ext"
Auth:         Bearer $HF_TOKEN
```

No client library. No hardcoded integration. An agent reads that, and it can drive
the Space end to end. Set an
[`HF_TOKEN`](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
and you're going.

The real unlock is
**chaining**
: the output of one Space becomes the input to the
next. Prompt → image → 3D. That's the whole pipeline behind this gallery.

## The worked example: Paris monuments → splats

The agent chained two Spaces:

1. **Image:**
   [`ideogram-ai/ideogram4`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ideogram-ai/ideogram4)
   turned each monument into a clean,
   dark-background "specimen" shot (and the Eiffel Tower into a little diorama on a
   plinth). Prompt in, image out.
2. **Splat:**
   [`VAST-AI/TripoSplat`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSplat)
   reconstructed a 3D Gaussian splat (
   `.ply`
   ) from each single image. Image in,
   3D out.

Generated image

The six source images the agent generated, all isolated on black, ready for
single-image 3D reconstruction:

[![Generated Arc de Triomphe](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-arc.jpg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-arc.jpg)
[![Generated Sacré-Cœur](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-sacre-coeur.jpg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-sacre-coeur.jpg)
[![Generated Eiffel diorama](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-eiffel-diorama.jpg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/resolve/main/blog/assets/gen-eiffel-diorama.jpg)

From there the agent did the "glue" work too. It noticed TripoSplat outputs are
Y-down and flipped them upright, auto-framed each monument, compressed the
`.ply`
files to
`.ksplat`
(~3× smaller, so they load fast), built a Three.js viewer with a
scroll-to-switch and drag-to-rotate UI, and deployed the whole thing as a static
Space. The only human inputs were taste-level: "make it zoomed out," "replace the
obelisk with something better for splatting," "the transition lingers too long."

Several of those steps were
**the agent reacting to reality**
. A wide glass pyramid
splats poorly. A thin obelisk is dull. A single-view reconstruction infers the
back. That is exactly the "outsourced R&amp;D, fast iteration" loop the building-block
economy predicts, except the R&amp;D was a conversation.

## Two prompts, a whole new gallery

The real test of a building block is how cheaply you can reuse it. Once this
pipeline existed, spinning up entirely new galleries cost about one sentence each.
"Create a similar Space with splats for Japan," then the same for Egypt, and the
agent did the rest: six monument images, six splats, compression, a viewer, and a
deployed Space, per country.

  [Monuments of Egypt](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-of-egypt)
  :
  the Great Pyramid, the Sphinx, Abu Simbel, the mask of Tutankhamun, Karnak, the
  Colossi of Memnon.

  [Monuments of Japan](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-of-japan)

  Kamakura, the Itsukushima torii.

Same two Spaces, same
`agents.md`
, only the prompts changed. That is the
building-block economy in one line: the marginal cost of a new multimedia app
falls toward the cost of describing it.

## Why this matters

* **Models become composable.**
  A SOTA splat model and a SOTA image model, from
  different orgs, chained with zero integration code. The Hub's open-weights
  catalog turns into a library of callable multimedia primitives.
* **Agents prefer what's documented and reachable.**
  `agents.md`
  makes a Space
  trivially reachable, so an agent will pick it over a model it has to set up by
  hand. That is the same dynamic Hashimoto flags for open-source libraries.
* **The barrier was integration, and it's largely gone.**
  "Turn a prompt into a
  rotating 3D monument" used to be a project. Here it was a step in a pipeline.

## Try it yourself

Point your own agent at a Space's
`agents.md`
and let it cook:

```
curl https://huggingface.co/spaces/ideogram-ai/ideogram4/agents.md

curl https://huggingface.co/spaces/VAST-AI/TripoSplat/agents.md
```

Paste either link into your coding agent (Claude Code, etc.), set your
`HF_TOKEN`
, and ask it to build something. The full, reproducible pipeline for this
gallery, the scripts that hit those two
`agents.md`
endpoints, lives in the
[Space repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mishig/monuments-de-paris/tree/main)
.

The building blocks are sitting right there on the Hub. The agents already know how
to glue.
