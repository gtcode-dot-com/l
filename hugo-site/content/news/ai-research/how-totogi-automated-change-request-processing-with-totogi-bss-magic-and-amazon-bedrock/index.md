*This post is cowritten by Nikhil Mathugar, Marc Breslow and Sudhanshu Sinha from Totogi.*

This blog post describes how Totogi automates change request processing.
[Totogi](https://totogi.com/)
is an AI company focused on helping helping telecom (telco) companies innovate, accelerate growth and adopt AI at scale.
[BSS Magic](https://totogi.com/products/bss-magic/)
, Totogi’s flagship product, connects and models telco business operations, overlaying legacy systems with an AI layer. With BSS Magic, telcos can extend, customize, and modernize their systems without vendor dependencies or lengthy implementations. By partnering with the
[AWS Generative AI Innovation Center](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/innovation-center/)
and using the rapid innovation capabilities of
[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)
, we accelerated the development of BSS Magic, helping Totogi’s customers innovate faster and gain more control over their tech stack.

In this post, we explore the challenges associated with the traditional business support system (BSS), and the innovative solutions provided by Totogi BSS Magic. We introduce intricacies of telco ontologies and the multi-agent framework that powers automated change request processing. Additionally, the post will outline the orchestration of AI agents and the benefits of this approach for telecom operators and beyond.

## Challenges with BSS

BSS are notoriously difficult to manage. A typical BSS stack consists of hundreds of different applications from various vendors. But those BSS applications are difficult to integrate, either restricting telcos to the vendor’s ecosystem or requiring them to invest in costly customizations. Such customizations are slow and resource-intensive because of their reliance on specialized engineering talent.

Each change request necessitates a thorough analysis of potential impacts across interconnected modules, consuming significant time and effort. Even small updates can involve multiple rounds of coding, testing, and reconfiguration to achieve stability. For telecom operators, where system reliability is critical, these safeguards are non-negotiable, but they come at a steep price. This process is further complicated by the scarcity of engineers with the necessary expertise, driving up costs and elongating timelines. As a result, development cycles for new features or services often take months to complete, leaving operators struggling to meet the demands of a fast-moving market.

Initiatives like
[TM Forum’s Open Digital Architecture (ODA)](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/about/)
aim to solve this, yet most vendors are slow to adopt such open standards. This dynamic amplifies technical debt and inflates operational expenses.

## BSS Magic solution overview

Totogi BSS Magic reduces the complexity using AI-generated interoperability, which helps simplify integrations, customizations, and application development. BSS Magic has two key aspects:

* **A telco ontology**
  that understands the semantic meanings of data structures and the relationships between them, linking disparate data into a coherent network of knowledge.
* **Multi-agent framework**
  for fully automated change requests (CR), which reduces CR processing time from 7 days to a few hours.

## Telco ontology: The key to interoperability

Ontologies serve as semantic blueprints that detail concepts, relationships, and domain knowledge. In telecom, this means translating the BSS landscape into a clear, reusable, and interoperable ecosystem. Totogi’s telco ontology facilitates a deep understanding of data interaction and seamless integration across any vendor or system.

By adopting FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), the ontology-driven architecture turns static, siloed data into dynamic, interconnected knowledge assets—unlocking trapped data and accelerating innovation. An overview diagram of the ontology is provided in the following figure.

## Multi-agent framework for automated change request processing

AI agents are advanced software applications trained to perform specific tasks autonomously. Totogi’s BSS Magic AI agents have extensive domain knowledge and use this understanding to manage complex data interactions across multiple vendor systems. These agents automatically generate and test telco-grade code, replacing traditional integrations and customizations with intelligent, AI generated applications. At its core, BSS Magic uses a multi-agent AI approach with feedback loops to automate the entire software development pipeline. Each agent is designed to fulfill a specific role in the development pipeline:

* **Business analysis agent**
  translates unstructured requirements into formal business specifications.
* **Technical architect agent**
  takes these business specs and defines technical architectures, APIs, and dependencies.
* **Developer agent**
  generates high-quality, deployable code, complete with modular designs and optimizations.
* **QA agent**
  validates the code for adherence to best practices, improving quality and security. It provides feedback which is used by the developer agent to update the code.
* **Tester agent**
  generates robust unit test cases, streamlining validation and deployment. The result of the test cases is used by the developer agent to improve the code.

An overview of the system is provided in the following figure.

![](https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/f1f836cb4ea6efb2a0b1b99f41ad8b103eff4b59/2026/01/15/totogi-1.png)

This integrated pipeline reduces the time to complete a change request from 7 days to a few hours, with minimal human intervention. The prerequisites for implementing the system include an AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock,
[AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/)
,
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/)
, and configured Amazon credentials. The AI agents are implemented using Anthropic Claude large language models (LLMs) through Amazon Bedrock. State management and workflow coordination are handled by Step Functions for reliable progression through each stage. The AWS infrastructure provides the enterprise-grade reliability, security, and scalability essential for telco-grade solutions.

To build the framework, Totogi collaborated with the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center (GenAIIC). GenAIIC offered access to AI expertise, industry-leading talent, and a rigorous iterative process to optimize the AI agents and code-generation workflows. It also provided guidance on prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), model selection, automated code review, feedback loops, robust performance metrics for evaluating AI-generated outputs, and so on. The collaboration helped establish methods for maintaining reliability while scaling automation across the platform. The solution orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to handle the complete software development lifecycle, from requirements analysis to test execution. The details of the AI agents are given in the following sections.

## Multi-agent orchestration layer

The orchestration layer coordinates specialized AI agents through a combination of Step Functions and Lambda functions. Each agent maintains context through RAG and few-shot prompting techniques to generate accurate domain-specific outputs. The system manages agent communication and state transitions while maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of decisions and actions.

## Business analysis generation

The Business Analyst agent uses Claude’s natural language understanding capabilities to process statement of work (SOW) documents and acceptance criteria. It extracts key requirements using custom prompt templates optimized for telecom BSS domain knowledge. The agent generates structured specifications for downstream processing while maintaining traceability between business requirements and technical implementations.

## Technical architecture generation

The Technical Architect agent transforms business requirements into concrete AWS service configurations and architectural patterns. It generates comprehensive API specifications and data models and incorporates
[AWS Well-Architected](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
principles. The agent validates architectural decisions against established patterns and best practices, producing infrastructure-as-code templates for automated deployment.

## Code generation pipeline

The Developer agent converts technical specifications into implementation code using Claude’s advanced code generation capabilities. It produces robust, production-ready code that includes proper error handling and logging mechanisms. The pipeline incorporates feedback from validation steps to iteratively improve code quality and maintain consistency with AWS best practices.

## Automated quality assurance

The QA agent is built using Claude to perform comprehensive code analysis and validation. It evaluates code quality and identifies potential performance issues. The system maintains continuous feedback loops with the development stage, facilitating rapid iteration and improvement of generated code based on quality metrics and best practices adherence. The QA process consists of carefully crafted prompts.

QA code analysis prompt:

```
"You are a senior QA backend engineer analyzing Python code for serverless applications.
Your task is to:
Compare requirements against implemented code
Identify missing features
Suggest improvements in code quality and efficiency
 Provide actionable feedback
Focus on overall implementation versus minor details
Consider serverless best practices"
```

This prompt helps the QA agent perform thorough code analysis, evaluate quality metrics, and maintain continuous feedback loops with development stages.

## Test automation framework

The Tester agent creates comprehensive test suites that verify both functional and non-functional requirements. It uses Claude to understand test contexts and generate appropriate test scenarios. The framework manages test refinement through evaluation cycles, achieving complete coverage of business requirements while maintaining test code quality and reliability. The testing framework uses a multi-stage prompt approach.

Initial test structure prompt:

```
"As a senior QA engineer, create a pytest-based test structure including:
Detailed test suite organization
Resource configurations
Test approach and methodology
Required imports and dependencies"
```

Test implementation prompt:

```
"Generate complete pytest implementation including:
Unit tests for each function
Integration tests for API endpoints
AWS service mocking
Edge case coverage
Error scenario handling"
```

Test results analysis prompt:

```
"Evaluate test outputs and coverage reports to:
Verify test completion status
Track test results and outcomes
Measure coverage metrics
Provide actionable feedback"
```

This structured approach leads to comprehensive test coverage while maintaining high quality standards. The framework currently achieves 76% code coverage and successfully validates both functional and non-functional requirements.

The Tester agent provides a feedback loop to the Development agent to improve the code.
