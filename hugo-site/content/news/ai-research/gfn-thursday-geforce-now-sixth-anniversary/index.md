Break out the cake and green sprinkles —
[GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/)
is turning six.

Since launch, members have streamed over 1 billion hours, and the party’s just getting started.

Throughout February, members can look forward to new games, fresh ways to play across more devices and even more ways to bring RTX power to every screen in the house.

There’s plenty to celebrate: the February games list kicks off with 24 new games. Start with the 10 new games in the cloud this week, including the launch of Team Jade’s
*Delta Force*
and the newest title launching in the PUBG universe,
*PUBG: BLINDSPOT.*

## **Reporting for Duty**

*The ultimate extraction.*

*Delta Force*
, now boots on the ground and fully deployed on GeForce NOW, brings the tactical first‑person shooter from Team Jade (TiMi Studio Group) to the cloud. The game features high-stakes extraction with an all-out warfare mode, giving players a playground of open environments, vehicles and gadgets to pull off coordinated assaults.

Players join elite units tasked with tackling high‑risk missions across sprawling maps, from tight urban incursions to rugged open‑terrain operations. Expect strategic objectives, combined‑arms combat with land, air and sea vehicles, and tense firefights where teamwork and planning are just as important as quick reflexes.

On GeForce NOW,
*Delta Force*
leans into its high‑octane personality: fast drops, big maps and cinematic engagements that look sharp and feel responsive across devices. Members can squad up from almost anywhere, enjoy high‑resolution streaming and smooth performance, and stay ready for every op without waiting on downloads or big updates before jumping into the next mission.

## **New Mission**

*Squad up.*

*PUBG: BLINDSPOT*
, a new spin-off set in the PUBG universe from Krafton, expands the franchise with a standalone 5v5 top-down tactical shooter.

Set across tightly designed maps, matches focus on information, positioning and coordinated team play, with squads clearing angles, locking down objectives and outmaneuvering opponents in fast, round-based firefights. Every callout and ability use matters, turning each round into a layered tactical puzzle rather than a simple test of reflexes.

On GeForce NOW, responsive streaming and sharp RTX-powered visuals keep every angle, rotation and clutch play feeling precise, even on lower-powered devices. With support across a wide range of screens, the cloud makes it easy for the gaming squad to jump right into the action, without lengthy downloads or updates getting in the way.
