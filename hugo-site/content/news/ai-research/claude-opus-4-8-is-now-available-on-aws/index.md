Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of Anthropic’s most advanced Opus model, Claude Opus 4.8, on Amazon Bedrock and the
[Claude Platform on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introducing-claude-platform-on-aws-anthropics-native-platform-through-your-aws-account/)
. Claude Opus 4.8 represents a meaningful step forward, delivering improvements across the workflows teams run in production, from agentic coding and deep knowledge work to multi-stage autonomous tasks that span hours of independent operation. With Claude Opus 4.8 on Amazon Bedrock you can build within your existing AWS environment, maintain enterprise security and regional data residency, and scale inference. Claude Opus 4.8 is also available through Claude Platform on AWS, giving you Anthropic’s native platform experience when regional data residency isn’t required.

This post covers Opus 4.8’s improvements and practical guidance for AI engineers integrating the model into agentic systems and production inference workloads on Amazon Bedrock. See the
[documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/claude-platform/)
for Claude Platform on AWS.

## What makes Claude Opus 4.8 different

[Claude Opus 4.8](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-8)
is designed to change what teams can hand off to Claude, with stronger performance across coding, agentic tasks, and professional work, and the consistency and autonomy intended for long-running production workflows. Opus 4.8 can hold a plan across stages, better track what it has done and what remains, and adjust course when something breaks rather than surfacing an error and stopping. This should lead to more predictable behavior at scale with lower output variance and fewer review cycles.

In coding, Opus 4.8 is designed to navigate real codebases, plan before editing, and maintain context across long sessions. On multi-stage tasks, it can track dependencies and sustain coherence over extended runs. This same autonomy extends into agentic workflows, where it can handle complex dependency chains and multi-step tool use with reduced oversight, making it a strong fit for both customer-facing and internal agents. In professional work, Opus 4.8 synthesizes long, complex sources into structured deliverables such as briefs, analyses, and reports.

## Industry Use Cases

Claude Opus 4.8 capabilities are a good fit for industries where consistency and depth matter most. For financial services teams, Opus 4.8 assists with investment research and earnings analysis, carrying context across an entire reporting cycle. For legal teams, it enables contract review, due diligence, and first drafts of motions and memos. In life sciences, it helps with literature review, regulatory submission drafting, and trial data synthesis. In cybersecurity, it strengthens threat intelligence synthesis, vulnerability finding, and incident response by holding long traces and large codebases in context.

## Getting Started with Claude Opus 4.8 on Amazon Bedrock

You can get started with Claude Opus 4.8 in the
[Amazon Bedrock console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el)
.

1. In the Amazon Bedrock console, under
   **Test**
   , choose
   **Playground**
   .
2. For the model, choose Claude Opus 4.8Now, you can test your complex coding prompt with the model.

*Amazon Bedrock console Playground with Claude Opus 4.8 selected*

You can also access the model programmatically using the
[Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-anthropic-claude-messages.html?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el)
to call the
`bedrock-runtime`
through Anthropic SDK or
`bedrock-mantle`
endpoints, or keep using the
[Invoke](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-api.html)
and
[Converse API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html?trk=d8ec3b19-0f37-4f8c-8c12-189f913e205c&amp;sc_channel=el)
on
`bedrock-runtime`
through the
[AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el)
and
[AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/tools/?trk=769a1a2b-8c19-4976-9c45-b6b1226c7d20&amp;sc_channel=el)
.

**Prerequisites**

1. Active AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access
2. AWS CLI installed and configured
3. Python 3.8+
4. Boto3 installed:
   `pip install boto3`
5. IAM permissions:
   `bedrock:InvokeModel`
   and
   `bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream`

Here’s a quick example using the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3):

```
import boto3
import json
# Create a Bedrock Runtime client
bedrock_runtime = boto3.client(
    service_name="bedrock-runtime",
    region_name="us-east-1"
)
# Invoke Claude Opus 4.8
response = bedrock_runtime.invoke_model(
    modelId="us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8",
    contentType="application/json",
    accept="application/json",
    body=json.dumps({
        "anthropic_version": "bedrock-2023-05-31",
        "max_tokens": 4096,
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Design a distributed architecture on AWS in Python that should support 100k requests per second across multiple geographic regions."
            }
        ]
    })
)
result = json.loads(response["body"].read())

print(result["content"][0]["text"])
```

You can also use Claude Opus 4.8 with the Amazon Bedrock Converse API for a unified multi-model experience:

```
import boto3
bedrock_runtime = boto3.client("bedrock-runtime", region_name="us-east-1")
response = bedrock_runtime.converse(
    modelId="us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "text": "Design a distributed architecture on AWS in Python that should support 100k requests per second across multiple geographic regions."
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    inferenceConfig={
        "maxTokens": 4096
    }
)
print(response["output"]["message"]["content"][0]["text"])
```
