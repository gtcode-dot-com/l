NVIDIA today released
[Cosmos Reason 2](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Reason2-8B)
, the latest advancement in open, reasoning vision language models for physical AI. Cosmos Reason 2 surpasses its previous version in accuracy and tops the
[Physical AI Bench](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shi-labs/physical-ai-bench-leaderboard)
and
[Physical Reasoning](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/physical_reasoning_leaderboard)
leaderboards as the #1 open model for visual understanding.

## NVIDIA Cosmos Reason 2: Reasoning Vision Language Model for Physical AI

Since their introduction,
[vision-language models](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/vision-language-models/)
have rapidly improved at tasks like object and pattern recognition in images. But they still struggle with tasks humans find natural, like planning several steps ahead, dealing with uncertainty or adapting to new situations. Cosmos Reason is designed to close this gap by giving robots and AI agents stronger common sense and reasoning to solve complex problems step by step.

Cosmos Reason 2 is a state-of-the-art, open reasoning vision-language model (VLM) that enables robots and AI agents to see, understand, plan, and act in the physical world like humans. It uses common sense, physics, and prior knowledge to recognize how objects move across space and time to handle complex tasks, adapt to new situations, and figure out how to solve problems step by step.

### ✨ Key Highlights

* Improved spatio-temporal understanding and timestamp precision.
* Optimized performance with flexible deployment options from edge to cloud with 2B and 8B parameters model sizes.
* Support for expanded set of spatial understanding and visual perception capabilities — 2D/3D point localization, bounding box coordinates, trajectory data, and OCR support.
* Improved long-context understanding with 256K input tokens, up from 16K with Cosmos Reason 1.
* Adaptable to multiple use cases with easy-to-use
  [Cosmos Cookbook recipes](https://nvidia-cosmos.github.io/cosmos-cookbook/index.html)
  .

### 🤖 Popular Use Cases

* **Video analytics AI agents**
  — These agents can extract valuable insights from massive volumes of video data to optimize processes. Cosmos Reason 2 builds on the capabilities of Cosmos Reason 1 and now provides OCR support, as well as 2D/3D point localization and a set of mark understanding.

  Example of how Cosmos Reason can understand text embedded within a video to determine the condition of the road during a rainstorm.

  Developers can jumpstart development of video analytics AI agents by using the
  [NVIDIA blueprint for video search and summarization (VSS)](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/video-search-and-summarization)
  with Cosmos Reason as the VLM.

  [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com/blog/the-new-frontier-of-physical-ai-how-salesforce-and-nvidia-turn-robots-into-enterprise-agents/)
  is transforming workplace safety and compliance by analyzing video footage captured by Cobalt robots with Agentforce and VSS blueprint with Cosmos Reason as the VLM.
* **Data annotation and critique**
  — Enable developers to automate high-quality annotation and critique of massive, diverse training datasets. Cosmos Reason provides time stamps and detailed descriptions for real or synthetically generated training videos.

  [Uber is exploring Cosmos Reason 2](https://nvidia-cosmos.github.io/cosmos-cookbook/recipes/post_training/reason2/video_caption_vqa/post_training.html)
  to deliver accurate, searchable video captions for autonomous vehicle (AV) training data, enabling efficient identification of critical driving scenarios. This
  [co-authored Reason 2 for AV Video Captioning and VQA recipe](https://nvidia-cosmos.github.io/cosmos-cookbook/recipes/post_training/reason2/video_caption_vqa/post_training.html)
  demonstrates how to fine-tune and evaluate Cosmos Reason 2-8B on annotated AV videos. Across multiple evaluation metrics, measurable improvements were achieved: BLEU scores improved 10.6% (0.113 → 0.125), MCQ-based VQA gained 0.67 percentage points (80.18% → 80.85%), and LingoQA increased 13.8% (63.2% → 77.0%). These gains demonstrate effective domain adaptation for AV applications.
* **Robot planning and reasoning**
  — Act as the brain for deliberate, methodical decision-making in a robot vision language action (VLA) model. Cosmos Reason 2 now provides trajectory coordinates in addition to determining next steps.
