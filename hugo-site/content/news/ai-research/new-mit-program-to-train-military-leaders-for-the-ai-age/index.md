Artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and enable action with reduced risk and greater precision, making it a critical tool for national security. A new program offered jointly by the MIT departments of Mechanical Engineering (Course 2, MechE) and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6, EECS) will provide breadth and depth in technical studies for naval officers, as well as a path for non-naval officers studying at MIT, to grow in their understanding of applied AI for naval and military applications.

“The potential for artificial intelligence is just starting to be fully realized. It’s a tool that dramatically improves speed, efficiency, and decision-making with countless applications,” says Commander Christopher MacLean, MIT associate professor of the practice in mechanical engineering, naval construction, and engineering. “AI is a force multiplier that can be used for data processing, decision support, unmanned and autonomous systems, cyber defense, logistics and supply chains, energy management, and many other fields.”

The program, called “
[2N6: Applied Artificial Intelligence Program for Naval Officers](https://2n6.mit.edu/)
,” comprises a two-year master of science degree in mechanical engineering with an accompanying AI certificate awarded by the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing.

“The officers entering this program will learn from the world’s experts, and conduct cutting-edge relevant research, and will exit the program best prepared for their roles as leaders across the U.S. naval enterprise,” says MacLean.

The
[2N6 curriculum](https://2n6.mit.edu/curriculum/)
is application focused, and the content is built to satisfy the U.S. Navy’s sub-specialty code for Applied Artificial Intelligence. Students will learn core AI concepts, as well as applications to special topics, such as decision-making for computational exercises; AI for manufacturing and design, with special emphasis on navy applications; and AI for marine autonomy of surface and underwater vehicles.

“The expanding influence of artificial intelligence is redefining our approach to problem-solving. AI holds the potential to address some of the most pressing issues in nearly every field,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “I’m honored that the college can contribute to and support such a vital program that will equip our nation’s naval officers with the technical expertise they need for mission-relevant challenges.”

MIT has been a leading center of ship research and design for over a century, with work at the Institute today representing significant advancements in fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics, acoustics, offshore mechanics, marine robotics and sensors, and ocean sensing and forecasting. The
[2N program](https://2n.mit.edu/)
will celebrate its 125th year at MIT in 2026.

“In MechE, we are embracing the use of AI to explore new frontiers in research and education, with deep grounding in the fundamentals, design, and scaling of physical systems,” says John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of MechE. “With the 2N6 program, we’re proud to be at the helm of such an important charge in training the next generation of leaders for the Navy.”

“Breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are reshaping society and advancing human decision-making and creativity,” says Asu Ozdaglar, deputy dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, head of EECS, and MathWorks Professor. “We are delighted to partner with the Department of Mechanical Engineering in launching this important collaboration with the U.S. Navy. The program will explore not only the forefront of AI advances, but also its effective application in Navy operations.”

2N6 was created following a visit to campus from Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, with MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, who was then dean of engineering and chief innovation and strategy officer.

“[Admiral Paparo] was given an overview of some of the cutting-edge work and research that MIT has done and is doing in the field of AI, [and was introduced to the 2N program],” says MacLean. “The admiral made the connection, envisioning an applied AI program similar to 2N.”

2N6 will run as a pilot program for at least two years. The program’s first cohort will comprise only U.S. Navy officers, with plans to expand more broadly.

“We are thrilled to build on the long-standing relationship between MIT and the U.S. Navy with this new program,” says Themis Sapsis, William I. Koch Professor in mechanical engineering and the director of the Center for Ocean Engineering at MIT. “It is specifically designed to train naval officers on the fundamentals and applications of AI, but also involve them in research that has direct impact to the Navy. We believe that 2N6 can model a new paradigm for advanced AI education focused more broadly on supporting national security.”
