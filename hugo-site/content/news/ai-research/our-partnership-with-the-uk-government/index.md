AI presents an opportunity to build a more prosperous and secure world.

The UK has already laid a strong foundation to seize this moment and is uniquely positioned to translate AI innovation into public benefit. Thatâs why we are excited to deepen our collaboration with the UK government to accelerate this work and offer a blueprint for other countries.

Together we will focus on using AI to speed up progress in science and education, modernize public services and advance national security and resilience.

## Accelerating access to frontier AI in key sectors: Science & Education

Our partnership will center on providing access to frontier AI in two areas foundational to the UKâs long-term success: scientific discovery and education.

The UK has a rich history of applying new technologies to drive scientific progress, from Hookeâs microscope to Faradayâs electrical experiments. We aim to build on this heritage, and empower the next generation of scientists with AI tools that can unlock breakthroughs, transform the economy, and solve some of the major challenges facing humanity. We will provide priority access to our âAI for Scienceâ models to UK scientists, including:

* [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/)
  - a Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms
* [AlphaGenome](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphagenome-ai-for-better-understanding-the-genome/)
  - an AI model to help scientists better understand our DNA
* [AI co-scientist](https://research.google/blog/accelerating-scientific-breakthroughs-with-an-ai-co-scientist/)
  - a multi-agent AI system that acts as a virtual scientific collaborator
* [WeatherNext](https://deepmind.google/science/weathernext/)
  - a family of state-of-the-art weather forecasting models

Like the microscope or telescope, these AI tools are designed to enhance scientific capacity, enabling researchers to tackle problems of unprecedented complexity and scale. For example, AlphaFold - our AI system for predicting protein structures - has already enabled almost 190,000 researchers in the UK alone to deepen their understanding of areas such as crop resilience, antimicrobial resistance and other critical biological challenges.

### Establishing Google DeepMindâs first automated science laboratory in the UK

To help turbocharge scientific discovery, we will establish Google DeepMindâs first automated laboratory in the UK in 2026, specifically focused on materials science research. A multidisciplinary team of researchers will oversee research in the lab, which will be built from the ground up to be fully integrated with Gemini. By directing world-class robotics to synthesize and characterize hundreds of materials per day, the team intends to significantly shorten the timeline for identifying transformative new materials.

Discovering new materials is one of the most important pursuits in science, offering the potential to reduce costs and enable entirely new technologies. For example, superconductors that operate at ambient temperature and pressure could allow for low cost medical imaging and reduce power loss in electrical grids. Other novel materials could help us tackle critical energy challenges by unlocking advanced batteries, next-generation solar cells and more efficient computer chips.
