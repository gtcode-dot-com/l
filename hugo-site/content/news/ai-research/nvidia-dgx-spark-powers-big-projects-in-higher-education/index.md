At leading institutions across the globe, the
[NVIDIA DGX Spark](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/products/workstations/dgx-spark/)
desktop supercomputer is bringing data‑center‑class AI to lab benches, faculty offices and students’ systems. There’s even a DGX Spark hard at work in the South Pole, at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory run by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The compact supercomputer’s petaflop‑class performance enables local deployment of large AI applications, from clinical report evaluators to robotics perception systems, all while keeping sensitive data on site and shortening iteration loops for researchers and learners.

Powered by the NVIDIA GB10 superchip and the NVIDIA DGX operating system, each DGX Spark unit supports AI models of up to 200 billion parameters and integrates seamlessly with the
[NVIDIA NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/)
,
[Metropolis](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/intelligent-video-analytics-platform/)
,
[Holoscan](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/holoscan/)
and
[Isaac](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac)
platforms, giving students access to the same professional-grade tools used across the DGX ecosystem.

Read more below on how DGX Spark powers groundbreaking AI work at leading institutions worldwide.

## **IceCube Neutrino Observatory** **: Studying Particles in the South Pole**

At the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s IceCube Neutrino Observatory in Antarctica, researchers are using DGX Spark to run AI models for its experiments studying the universe’s most cataclysmic events, using subatomic particles called neutrinos.

Traditional astronomy methods, based on detecting light waves, enable observing about 80% of the known universe, according to Benedikt Riedel, computing director at the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center. A new way to explore the universe — using gravitational waves and particles like neutrinos — unlocks examining the most extreme cosmic environments, including those involving supernovas and dark matter.

“There’s no hardware store in the South Pole, which is technically a desert, with relative humidity under 5% and an elevation of 10,000 feet, meaning very limited power,” Riedel said. “DGX Spark allows us to deploy AI in a compartmentalized and easy fashion, at low cost and in such an extremely remote environment, to run AI analyses locally on our neutrino observation data.”

## **NYU** **: Using Agentic AI for Radiology Reports**

At NYU’s Global AI Frontier Lab, ​the
[ICARE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02808)
(Interpretable and Clinically‑Grounded Agent‑Based Report Evaluation) project runs end-to-end on a DGX Spark in the lab. ICARE uses collaborating AI agents and multiple‑choice question generation to evaluate how closely AI‑generated radiology reports align with expert sources, enabling real‑time clinical evaluation and continuous monitoring without sending medical imaging data to the cloud.​

“Being able to run powerful LLMs locally on the DGX Spark has completely changed my workflow,” said Lucius Bynum, data science assistant professor and a faculty fellow at the NYU Center for Data Science. “I have been able to focus my efforts on quickly iterating and improving the research tool I’m developing.”

NYU researchers also use DGX Spark to run LLMs locally as part of interactive causal modeling tools that generate and refine semantic causal models — structured, machine‑readable maps of cause‑and‑effect relationships between clinical variables, imaging findings and potential diagnoses. This setup lets teams rapidly design, test and iterate on advanced models without waiting for cluster resources, including for privacy- and security‑sensitive applications such as in healthcare, where data must stay on premises.​​

## **Harvard** **: Decoding Epilepsy With AI**

At Harvard’s Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence, neuroscientists are
[using DGX Spark](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/news/decoding-epilepsy/)
as a compact desktop supercomputer to probe how genetic mutations in the brain drive epilepsy. The system lets researchers run complex analyses in real time without needing to wait for access to large institutional clusters.​

The team, led by Kempner Institute Co-Director Bernardo Sabatini, is studying about 6,000 mutations in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, building protein-structure and neuronal-function prediction maps that guide which variants to test next in the lab.​

DGX Spark acts as a bridge between benchtop and cluster‑scale computing at Harvard. Researchers first validate workflows and timing on a single DGX Spark, then scale successful pipelines to large GPU clusters for massive protein screens.​

## **ASU** **: Enabling Campus‑Scale Innovation**

Arizona State University was
[among the first universities](https://tech.asu.edu/features/asu-among-first-receive-nvidias-newest-ai-supercomputer)
to receive multiple DGX Spark systems, which now support AI research across the campus, spanning initiatives for memory care, transportation safety and sustainable energy.​

One ASU team led by Yezhou “YZ” Yang, associate professor in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, is using DGX Spark to power advanced perception and robotics research, including for applications such as AI‑enabled, search-and-rescue robotic dogs and assistance tools for visually impaired users.

## **Mississippi State** **: Empowering Computer Science and Engineering Students**

In the computer science and engineering department at Mississippi State University, DGX Spark serves as a hands‑on learning platform for the next generation of AI engineers.

The enthusiasm around DGX Spark at Mississippi State is captured through lab‑driven outreach, including
[an unboxing video](https://www.instagram.com/reels/DRckpdAgvtR/)
created by a lab working to advance applied AI, foster AI workforce development and drive real-world AI experimentation across the state.

## **University of Delaware** **: Transforming Research Across Disciplines**

When ASUS delivered the school’s first Ascent GX10 — powered by DGX Spark —  Sunita Chandrasekaran, professor of computer and information sciences and director of the First State AI Institute, called it “transformative for research,” enabling teams across disciplines like sports analytics and coastal science to run large AI models directly on campus instead of relying on costly cloud resources. Through the
[ASUS Virtual Lab program](https://www.asus.com/us/business/blog/asus-ascent-gx10-ai-education-university-delaware/)
, schools can test GX10 performance remotely before deployment.

## **ISTA** **: Training Big LLMs on a Small Desktop**

At the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, researchers are using an HP ZGX Nano AI Station — a compact system based on NVIDIA DGX Spark — to train and fine‑tune LLMs right on a desktop. The team’s
[open source LLMQ software](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/llmq)
enables working with models of up to 7 billion parameters, making advanced LLM training accessible to more students and researchers.

Because the ZGX Nano includes 128GB of unified memory, the entire LLM and its training data can remain on the system, avoiding the complex memory juggling usually required on consumer GPUs. This helps teams move faster and keep sensitive data on premises. Read this
[research paper on ISTA’s LLMQ software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15306)

## **Stanford** **: A Pipeline for Prototyping**

At Stanford University, researchers are using DGX Spark to prototype complete training and evaluation pipelines to run their
[Biomni](https://biomni.stanford.edu/about/)
biological agent workflows locally before scaling to large GPU clusters. This enables a tight, iterative loop for model development and benchmarking, and automates complex analysis and experimental planning directly in the lab environment.

The Stanford research team reported that DGX Spark provides performance similar to big cloud GPU instances — about 80 tokens per second on a 120 billion‑parameter gpt‑oss model at MXFP4 via Ollama — while keeping the entire workload on a desktop.

College students from across the globe are invited to participate in
[Treehacks](https://treehacks.com/)
, a massive student hackathon running Feb. 13-15 at Stanford, which will feature DGX Spark units from ASUS.
