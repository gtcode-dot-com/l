- body: Floods are the most common natural disaster and cause roughly $50 billion
    in annual damages. The rate of flood-related disasters has doubled since 2000,
    influenced by climate change.
  title: Context
- body: Nearly 1.5 billion people, about 19% of the world’s population, live with
    substantial flood risk; better early warnings can save thousands of lives each
    year.
  title: Exposure and Impact
- body: Since 2017, the effort has combined AI research with developing a real-time
    operational flood forecasting system that provides alerts.

  description: Floods are the most common natural disaster, causing about $50 billion
    in annual damages worldwide. The rate of flood-related disasters has more than
    doubled since 2000, in part due to climate change. Nearly 1.5 billion people,
    about 19% of the world’s population, are exposed to substantial flood risk. Upgrading
    early warning systems to deliver accurate, timely information can save thousands
    of lives per year. Since 2017, a global flood forecasting effort has advanced
    AI research while building a real-time operational forecast system that issues
    alerts.

Floods are the
[most common natural disaster](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e218989e-8b3b-5f8c-944c-06e9812215aa/content)
, and are responsible for roughly
[$50 billion](https://www.swissre.com/risk-knowledge/mitigating-climate-risk/floods.html)
in annual financial damages worldwide. The
[rate of flood-related disasters has more than doubled](https://library.wmo.int/records/item/57630-2021-state-of-climate-services-water?offset=1#:~:text=WMO%2DNo.,1278&text=More%20than%202%20billion%20people,for%20the%20past%2020%20years.)
since the year 2000 partly
[due to climate change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70816-2)
. Nearly
[1.5 billion people](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/e218989e-8b3b-5f8c-944c-06e9812215aa/content)
, making up 19% of the world’s population, are exposed to substantial risks from severe flood events. Upgrading early warning systems to make accurate and timely information accessible to these populations
[can save thousands of lives per year](https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/1813-9450-6058)
.

Driven by the potential impact of reliable flood forecasting on people’s lives globally, we started our flood forecasting effort in 2017. Through this
[multi-year journey](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-ai-global-flood-forecasting/)
, we advanced research over the years hand-in-hand with building a real-time operational flood forecasting system that
[provides alerts](https://blog.google/technology/ai/expanding-our-ml-based-flood-forecasting/)
on Google Search, Maps, Android notifications and through the
[Flood Hub](http://g.co/floodhub)
. However, in order to
[scale globally](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/flood-hub-ai-flood-forecasting-more-countries/)
, especially in places where accurate local data is not available, more research advances were required.

In “
[Global prediction of extreme floods in ungauged watersheds](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07145-1)
”, published in
[*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/)
, we demonstrate how machine learning (ML) technologies can significantly improve global-scale
[flood forecasting](https://sites.research.google/floodforecasting/)
relative to the current state-of-the-art for countries where flood-related data is scarce. With these AI-based technologies we extended the reliability of currently-available global nowcasts, on average, from zero to five days, and improved forecasts across regions in Africa and Asia to be similar to what are currently available in Europe. The evaluation of the models was conducted in collaboration with the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (
[ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/)
).

These technologies also enable
[Flood Hub](http://g.co/floodhub)
to provide real-time river forecasts up to seven days in advance,
[covering](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/flood-hub-ai-flood-forecasting-more-countries/)
river reaches across over 80 countries. This information can be used by people, communities, governments and international organizations to take anticipatory action to help protect vulnerable populations.
