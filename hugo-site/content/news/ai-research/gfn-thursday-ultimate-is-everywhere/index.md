The
[NVIDIA Blackwell RTX upgrade](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-blackwell-rtx-launch/)
is nearing the finish line, letting
[GeForce NOW](https://geforcenow.com)
Ultimate members across the globe experience true next-generation cloud gaming from anywhere.

Everyone’s talking about Ultimate memberships — including GeForce NOW partner 2K.

“With GeForce NOW Ultimate, top-tier streaming truly goes everywhere,” said Sean Haran, head of partnerships and licensing at 2K. “Anyone can experience the glory of
*Borderlands 4*
, with breathtaking graphics and flawless gameplay powered by GeForce RTX 5080 servers, even without the latest devices. Jump into the cloud and play at high settings, whether you’re at home or on the move.”

The community has plenty to say about Ultimate, too. The GeForce NOW Community Video Contest invites gamers to share how GeForce NOW has changed the way they play. Participants can earn two Ultimate day passes — one to keep and one to share with a gaming buddy — and a chance to win a one-year Ultimate membership, just for submitting a clip.

Plus, the celebration continues with free in-game skins for both
*Guild Wars II*
and
*Borderlands 4*
.

And Capcom’s
*Ace Attorney*
headlines the lineup of nine new titles joining the cloud this week, alongside even more ways to jump in with the new Chromebook Fast Pass.

Stockholm will soon be the final region to get Blackwell RTX power, completing the rollout of GeForce RTX 5080-class performance worldwide. Ultrasmooth streaming, cutting-edge visuals and lightning-fast responsiveness are unlocking new levels of performance for Ultimate members.

## **The Ultimate Leap**

*Ultimate is everywhere, with Stockholm to be the final region to upgrade.*

GeForce RTX 5080-class performance is lighting up regions around the globe, powered by the Blackwell RTX upgrade.

Ultimate now streams at up to 5K at 120 frames per second or up to 360 fps at 1080p for sharp, competitive play. Expect cinematic-quality visuals, advanced ray tracing and AI-powered performance that makes every frame shine on nearly any device. From the neon buzz of
*Cyberpunk 2077*
to the over-the-top chaos of
*Borderlands 4*
, gaming has never looked — or felt — this good.

With high-dynamic-range visuals, support for racing wheels, ultrawide displays, gaming handhelds running up to 90 fps and an expanded library of over 4,000 games thanks to the Install-to-Play feature — GeForce NOW enables every gamer to play bigger, go longer and jump right into blockbuster adventures without worrying about hardware.

## **The Ultimate Contest**

![S1 Battlefield 6 on GeForce NOW](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GFN_Thursday-Battlefield_6_S1-1680x945.jpg)


*Rise from the rubble.*

“Season 1: California Resistance” is Battlefield 6’s second major update, transforming luxurious pools and private golf courses into a sprawling combat zone, with new updates to Battlefield 6 and free-to-play ‘REDSEC’ experience. New maps stretch across abandoned city blocks and fractured coastlines, while fresh factions, vehicles and gadgets bring new strategies to the fight. It’s the dawn of a new chapter for Battlefield 6, full of surprises waiting behind every collapsing wall and cloud of dust.

Squad coordination, reactive destruction and cinematic weather events keep every round unpredictable. Storm idyllic fairways and jump into chaos with an all-new Golf Cart on the new MP Map Eastwood. Even on the back nine, every explosion feels and takedown feels bigger, bolder and more cinematic than before.
