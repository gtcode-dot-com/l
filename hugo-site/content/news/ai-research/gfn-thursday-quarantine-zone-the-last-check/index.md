## **Welcome to the Zone**

*Trust no one, file everything.*

*Quarantine Zone: The Last Check*
drops into the cloud this week, bringing the eerie isolation and grim decision-making of its Steam debut to any device powered by GeForce NOW.

Armed with advanced screening tools and instincts, players are put in charge of a critical checkpoint during a zombie outbreak — where one wrong choice could let the infection slip past the post. Screen survivors, manage scarce resources and hold back the undead. Holding the line is only the beginning — reinforce defenses and keep the camp alive as chaos intensifies with each passing day.

*Quarantine Zone: The Last Check*
streams at full GeForce RTX 5080 power for GeForce NOW Ultimate members, bringing razor-sharp visuals and ultrasmooth performance to every tense border crossing. Every document check, difficult decision and late-night shift in the guard booth hits harder with maxed-out settings and buttery frame rates, all without long installs or hardware worries getting in the way of the paranoia.

No trip through the Devolver catalog would be complete without revisiting its eclectic, chaotic hits already streaming on GeForce NOW. Check out
*Cult of the Lamb*
,
*Ball x Pit*
,
*Hotline Miami*
,
*Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number*
,
*Inscryption*
and
*Enter the Gungeon*
— where every dodge roll matters and every chest hides mayhem.

Each of these titles showcases Devolver’s knack for daring design and unforgettable worlds — now all one click away through GeForce NOW.

## **Time to Play**

![Styx: Shards of Darkness](https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GFN_Thursday-Styx_Shards_of_Darkness-1680x840.jpg)


*Sink into the shadows and steal everything that isn’t nailed down.*

*Styx: Shards of Darkness*
sneaks back in with a signature goblin grin and a dagger never too far from trouble. Published by Focus Home Interactive, this stealth adventure leans into vertical level design, tight shadows and sarcastic commentary from gaming’s most lovable little assassin. Expect big, open environments to pick apart, a toolkit full of invisibility tricks, traps and clones, and plenty of chances to turn a quiet infiltration into chaotic improv when plans go sideways.
