## More on *Rewiring Democracy*

It’s been a month since
[*Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship*](https://www.schneier.com/books/rewiring-democracy/)
was published. From what we know, sales are good.

Some of the book’s forty-three chapters are available online: chapters

We need more reviews—six on Amazon is
[not enough](https://www.amazon.com/Rewiring-Democracy-Transform-Government-Citizenship/dp/0262049945)
, and no one has yet posted a viral TikTok review. One review was
[published](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03718-w)
in
*Nature*
and another on the RSA Conference
[website](https://www.rsaconference.com/library/blog/bens-book-of-the-month-rewiring-democracy)
, but more would be better. If you’ve read the book, please leave a review somewhere.

My coauthor and I have been doing all sort of book events, both online and in person. This
[book event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy-w4C6vfOc)
, with Danielle Allen at the Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center, is particularly good. We also have been doing a ton of podcasts, both separately and together. They’re all on the book’s
[homepage](https://www.schneier.com/books/rewiring-democracy/)
.

There are two live book events in December. If you’re in Boston, come
[see us](https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/programs/author-talk-rewiring-democracy-how-ai-will-transform-our-politics-government-and-citizenship)
at the MIT Museum on 12/1. If you’re in Toronto, you can
[see me](https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/event/rewiring-democracy)
at the Munk School at the University of Toronto on 12/2.

I’m also doing a live AMA on the book on the RSA Conference website on 12/16. Register
