  description: Microsoft is warning of a scam involving online payroll systems. Criminals
    use social engineering to steal people’s credentials, and then divert direct deposits
    into accounts that they control. Sometimes they do other things to make it harder
    for the victim to realize what is happening. I feel like this kind of thing is
    happening everywhere, with everything. As we move more of our personal and professional
    lives online, we enable criminals to subvert the very systems we rely on.
