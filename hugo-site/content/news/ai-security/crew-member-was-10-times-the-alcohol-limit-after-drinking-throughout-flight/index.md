A United Airlines flight attendant,
**Margit Lake**
, was
[found to be ten times over the legal alcohol limit for aviation personnel after consuming vodka on a flight](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15277379/US-air-stewardess-alcohol-downing-vodka-Heathrow.html)
from San Francisco to London Heathrow. The incident occurred on October 17, 2025, and resulted in Lake being taken to the hospital upon landing in London.

Lake, 56, who had worked for United Airlines for over two decades, reportedly brought her own miniature bottles of vodka onto the flight and consumed them during the journey. Paramedics detected alcohol on her breath and noted her low blood pressure upon their arrival at Heathrow. A blood test revealed a
[blood alcohol level of 216 milligrams](https://onemileatatime.com/news/united-flight-attendant-drinks-flight/)
, far exceeding the UK legal limit of 20 milligrams for flight attendants.

Following the incident, Lake resigned from her position and faced legal proceedings in the UK. She pleaded guilty to performing an aviation-related function while over the prescribed alcohol limit. The court fined her £1,461 ($1,870) and imposed additional charges, but did not sentence her to prison.

Lake's defense attorney stated that she was experiencing grief and isolation, which led her to consume alcohol to calm herself. Despite the severity of the situation,
[the court opted for a financial penalty, noting that there were no disruptions to the flight](https://viewfromthewing.com/united-flight-attendant-rushed-to-hospital-after-drinking-10-times-legal-limit-on-san-francisco-london-flight/)
