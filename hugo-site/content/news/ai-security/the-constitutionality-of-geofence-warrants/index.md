## The Constitutionality of Geofence Warrants

The US Supreme Court is
[considering](https://therecord.media/supreme-court-geofence-constitutionality)
the constitutionality of geofence warrants.

>
> Police probing the crime found security camera footage showing a man on a cell phone near the credit union that was robbed and asked Google to produce anonymized location data near the robbery site so they could determine who committed the crime. They did so, providing police with subscriber data for three people, one of whom was Chatrie. Police then searched Chatrie’s home and allegedly surfaced a gun, almost $100,000 in cash and incriminating notes.
