Emergency services were called to the scene at the intersection of Eurambeen-Streatham and Mount William roads at Stoneleigh - about 45 minutes west of Ballarat - shortly after 9.30am after the small car was T-boned by the truck.

Victoria Police initially reported two children and one adult died at the scene.

However, Major Collision Investigation Unit Detective Inspector Craig McEvoy said on Tuesday afternoon that a three-year-old boy, a 31-year-old woman and a 41-year-old man, who was driving the vehicle, were killed.

The boy's grandmother, also in the car, was flown to the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne.

"What we can establish is that there were three generations of family in a vehicle that was travelling in a westerly direction towards the intersection," Inspector McEvoy said.

"A B-double truck, unladen, has been travelling in a southern direction towards the intersection.

"What we do know is the car appears to have failed to stop at the stop sign, travelling directly into the intersection into the path of the truck ... the truck has t-boned the vehicle.

"That's caused the car to spin several times on its wheels before coming to rest on its passenger side."

He said there is nothing to indicate at this point that speed contributed to the crash.

Inspector McEvoy said the truck driver, local to the area, was on a run he was "quite familiar with", and was returning to the depot with an empty rig.

"The truck driver is shaken, as you'd expect. He's with family and friends, being supported by the trucking company owner," he said.

"The truck driver has been 100 per cent cooperative with police."

He said the scene was a harrowing sight for first responders.

"You've got a car that has been T-boned by a semi-trailer. Catastrophic injuries, significant damage to the car, which made extraction extremely difficult."

A report will be prepared for the coroner following the crash.

Inspector McEvoy said the tragedy highlights the importance of people being safe on regional roads.

"One life lost is one too many ... we have seen far too many lives lost this year," he said.

"Drive to the conditions, slow down, take your time. The difference between just a little bit over the speed limit is a couple of minutes to arriving at your destination."

Anyone who witnessed the incident or has dashcam footage is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

A confidential report can also be made online at crimestoppersvic.com.au.
