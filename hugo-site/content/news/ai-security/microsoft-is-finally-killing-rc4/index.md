## Microsoft Is *Finally* Killing RC4

After twenty-six years, Microsoft is
[finally upgrading](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/12/microsoft-will-finally-kill-obsolete-cipher-that-has-wreaked-decades-of-havoc/)
the last remaining instance of the encryption algorithm RC4 in Windows.

Fun fact: RC4 was a trade secret until I published the algorithm in the second edition of
*[Applied Cryptography](https://www.schneier.com/books/applied-cryptography/)*
in 1995.
