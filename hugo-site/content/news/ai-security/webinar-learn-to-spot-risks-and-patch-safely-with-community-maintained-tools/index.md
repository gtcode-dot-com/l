Software Security / Patch Management

If you're using community tools like
**Chocolatey**
or
**Winget**
to keep systems updated, you're not alone. These platforms are fast, flexible, and easy to work with—making them favorites for IT teams. But there's a catch...

The very tools that make your job easier might also be the reason your systems are at risk.

These tools are run by the community. That means anyone can add or update packages. Some packages may be old, missing safety checks, or changed by mistake or on purpose. Hackers look for these weak spots. This has already happened in places like NPM and PyPI. The same risks can happen with Windows tools too.

To help you patch safely without slowing down,
[there's a free webinar coming up](https://thehacker.news/resilient-patching?source=article)
. It's led by Gene Moody, Field CTO at
**Action1**
. He'll walk through how these tools work, where the risks are, and how to protect your systems while keeping updates on track.

In this session, he'll test how safe these tools really are. You'll get practical steps you can use right away—nothing theoretical, just what works.

The goal is not to scare you away from community tools. They're useful. But they need guardrails—rules that help you use them safely without slowing you down.

**You will learn:**

🔒 How to spot hidden risks

⚙️ How to set safety checks like source pinning, allow-lists, and hash/signature verification

📊 How to prioritize updates using known vulnerability data (KEV)

📦 How to choose between community tools, direct vendor sources, or a mix of both

If you're not sure when to use community repos and when to go straight to the vendor, this session will help you decide. You'll also see how to mix both in a safe way.

This webinar is for anyone who manages software updates—whether you're on a small team or a large one. If you've ever wondered what's really inside that next patch, this session is for you.

It's free to attend, and you'll leave with clear actions you can apply the same day.
