on Sunday (November 9). An update on the
[GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-sally-kirklands-urgent-medical-care)
fundraiser launched by the actress' friends in November 2024 to help pay for her "urgent medical care" needs also confirmed that Kirkland was in hospice care.

"This past year Sally fractured her four bones in her neck, right wrist, and her left hip. While recovering she developed two separate life-threatening infections. The combination of these injuries and infections have required extensive hospitalizations and rehab beyond the 100 days insurance will cover," the GoFundMe states.
