(TNND) —
The Trump administration is directing states to reverse the full SNAP benefits distributed last week under judicial orders, following a
[Supreme Court stay](https://thenationaldesk.com/top-videos/trump-administration-seeks-to-halt-snap-food-aid-payments-after-a-court-order-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program#)
that halts those rulings.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture issued its directive as more than two dozen states warned of “catastrophic operational disruptions” unless they are reimbursed for SNAP benefits authorized prior to the Supreme Court’s stay.

Democratic attorneys general and other nonprofits sued the Trump administration to maintain and continue funding the program in November despite the ongoing government shutdown. The court ruled in their favor last week, which led to a release of SNAP benefits to several states, and the Trump administration saying that the program could continue.

However, on Friday night, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the ruling ordering the disbursement of SNAP benefits while the Supreme Court considers the Trump administration’s appeal.

Jackson’s pause of the disbursement, led to the Department of Agriculture on Sunday writing to state SNAP directors to inform them that payments under the prior ruling will be considered “unauthorized.”

“To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” the deputy undersecretary of Agriculture, Patrick Penn, wrote to state SNAP directors. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”

Penn warned that states could face penalties if they did not comply with the pause. It remains unclear if the order applies to states who used their own funds to keep the program going, or only the ones relying solely on federal funds.
