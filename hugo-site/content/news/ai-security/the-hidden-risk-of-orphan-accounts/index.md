## **The Problem: The Identities Left Behind**

As organizations grow and evolve, employees, contractors, services, and systems come and go - but their accounts often remain. These abandoned or "orphan" accounts sit dormant across applications, platforms, assets, and cloud consoles.

The reason they persist isn't negligence - it's fragmentation.

Traditional IAM and IGA systems are designed primarily for human users and depend on manual onboarding and integration for each application - connectors, schema mapping, entitlement catalogs, and role modeling. Many applications never make it that far. Meanwhile, non-human identities (NHIs): service accounts, bots, APIs, and agent-AI processes are natively ungoverned, operating outside standard IAM frameworks and often without ownership, visibility, or lifecycle controls.

The result? A shadow layer of untracked identities forming part of the broader identity dark matter - accounts invisible to governance but still active in infrastructure.

## **Why They're Not Tracked**

1. **Integration Bottlenecks:**
   Every app requires a unique configuration before IAM can manage it. Unmanaged and local systems are rarely prioritized.
2. **Partial Visibility:**
   IAM tools see only the "managed" slice of identity - leaving behind local admin accounts, service identities, and legacy systems.
3. **Complex Ownership:**
   Turnover, mergers, and distributed teams make it unclear who owns which application or account.
4. **AI-Agents and Automation:**
   Agent-AI introduces a new category of semi-autonomous identities that act independently from their human operators, further breaking the IAM model.

## **The Real-World Risk**

Orphan accounts are the unlocked back doors of the enterprise.

They hold valid credentials, often with elevated privileges, but no active owner. Attackers know this and use them.

  - attackers entered via an
  **old/inactive VPN account**
  with no MFA. Multiple sources corroborate the "inactive/legacy" account detail.

  - breach came through a
  **"ghost" third-party vendor account**
  that wasn't deactivated (i.e., an orphaned/vendor account). SOC write-up from Barracuda Managed XDR.
* **M&A context**
  - during post-acquisition consolidation, it's common to discover thousands of stale accounts/tokens; Enterprises note orphaned (often NHI) identities as a persistent post-M&A threat, citing very high rates of still-active former employee tokens.

Orphan accounts fuel multiple risks:

* **Compliance exposure:**
  Violates least-privilege and deprovisioning requirements (ISO 27001, NIS2, PCI DSS, FedRAMP).
* **Operational inefficiency:**
  Inflated license counts and unnecessary audit overhead.
* **Incident response drag:**
  Forensics and remediation slow down when unseen accounts are involved.

## **The Way Forward: Continuous Identity Audit**

Enterprises need evidence, not assumptions. Eliminating orphan accounts requires full identity observability - the ability to see and verify every account, permission, and activity, whether managed or not.

Modern mitigation includes:

* Identity Telemetry Collection: Extract activity signals directly from applications, managed and unmanaged.
* Unified Audit Trail: Correlate joiner/mover/leaver events, authentication logs, and usage data to confirm ownership and legitimacy.
* Role Context Mapping: File real usage insights and privilege context into identity profiles - showing who used what, when, and why.
* Continuous Enforcement: Automatically flag or decommission accounts with no activity or ownership, reducing risk without waiting for manual reviews.

When this telemetry feeds into a central identity audit layer, it closes the visibility gap, turning orphan accounts from hidden liabilities into measurable, managed entities.

Identity Audit capability delivers this foundation. By combining application-level telemetry with automated audit collection, it provides verifiable, continuous insight into how identities - human, non-human, and agent-AI - are actually used.

It's not another IAM system; it's the connective tissue that ensures IAM decisions are based on evidence, not estimation.
