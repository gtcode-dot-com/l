    that the U.S. used cyberattacks or other technical capabilities to cut power off
    in Caracas during strikes on the Venezuelan capital that led to the capture of
    Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. If true, it would mark one of the most public
    uses of U.S. cyber power against another nation in recent memory. These operations
    are typically highly classified, and the U.S. is considered one of the most advanced
    nations in cyberspace operations globally.'
