  description: 'Really interesting blog post from Anthropic: In a recent evaluation
    of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage
    attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools,
    instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how
    barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly
    coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly
    patching known vulnerabilities. […] A notable development during the testing of
    Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks
    without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular,
    Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a
    high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach—­one of the costliest cyber
    attacks in history—­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host
    (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet
    4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code
    to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the
    original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet
    been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this
    approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt
    updates and patches. ...'

## AIs are Getting Better at Finding and Exploiting Internet Vulnerabilities

Really interesting

Read the whole thing. Automatic exploitation will be a major change in cybersecurity. And things are happening fast. There have been significant developments since I wrote

in October.
