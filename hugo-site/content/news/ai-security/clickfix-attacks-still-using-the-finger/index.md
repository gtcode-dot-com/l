***Introduction***

Since as early as November 2025, the
[finger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/finger)
protocol has been used in
[ClickFix](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/08/21/think-before-you-clickfix-analyzing-the-clickfix-social-engineering-technique/)
social engineering attacks. BleepingComputer posted
[a report of this activity on November 15th](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/decades-old-finger-protocol-abused-in-clickfix-malware-attacks/)
, and Didier Stevens posted a short follow-up
[in an ISC diary](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Fingerexe+ClickFix/32492/)
the next day.

I often investigate two campaigns that employ ClickFix attacks:
[KongTuke](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/32498)
and
[SmartApeSG](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/32474)
. When I checked earlier this week on Thursday, December 11th, both campaigns used commands that ran
finger.exe
in Windows to retrieve malicious content.

So after nearly a month, ClickFix attacks are still giving us the finger.

*Shown above: ClickFix attacks running
finger.exe
.*

***KongTuke Example***

My investigation of KongTuke activity on December 11th revealed a command for
finger gcaptcha@captchaver[.]top
from the fake CAPTCHA page.

*Shown above: Example of fake CAPTCHA page from the KongTuke campaign on December 11th, 2025.*

I recorded network traffic generated by running this ClickFix script, and I used the
finger
filter in Wireshark to find finger traffic over TCP port 79.

*Shown above: Finding finger traffic using the
finger
filter in Wireshark.*

Following the TCP stream of this traffic revealed text returned from the server. The result was a
powershell
command with Base64 encoded text.

*Shown above: Text returned from the server in response to the
finger
command.*

***SmartApeSG Example***

My investigation of SmartApeSG activity on December 11th revealed a command for
finger
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
[.]108
from the fake CAPTCHA page.

[![](https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/2025-12-13-ISC-Diary-image-03.png)](https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/2025-12-13-ISC-Diary-image-03.png)

*Shown above: Example of fake CAPTCHA page from the SmartApeSG campaign on December 11th, 2025.*

I recorded network traffic generated by running this ClickFix script, and I used the
finger
filter in Wireshark to find finger traffic over TCP port 79.

*Shown above: Finding finger traffic using the
finger
filter in Wireshark.*

Following the TCP stream of this traffic revealed text returned from the server. The result was a script to retrieve content from
pmidpils[.]com/yhb.jpg
then save and run that content on the user's Windows host.

*Shown above: Text returned from the server in response to the
finger
command.*

***Final Words***

As Didier Stevens noted in
[last month's diary](https://isc.sans.edu/diary/32492)
about this activity, corporate environments with an explicit proxy will block TCP port 79 traffic generated by
finger.exe
. However, if TCP port 79 traffic isn't blocked, these attacks could still be effective.
