  description: '404 Media has the story: Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are
    designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras
    are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles.
    Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people’s faces as they walk
    through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they
    can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock’s website.
    We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in
    suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot
    in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film
    high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were
    able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway
    bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past.
    Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down
    the bike path. The camera’s resolution was good enough that we were able to see
    that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading
    videos on his phone...'
