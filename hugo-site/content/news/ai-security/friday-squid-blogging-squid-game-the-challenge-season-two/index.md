## Friday Squid Blogging: *Squid Game: The Challenge* , Season Two

The second season of the Netflix reality competition show
*Squid Game: The Challenge*
has dropped. (Too many links to pick a few—search for it.)

As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.
