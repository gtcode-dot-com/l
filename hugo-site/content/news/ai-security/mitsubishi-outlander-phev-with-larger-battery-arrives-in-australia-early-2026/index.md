The upgraded plug-in hybrid drivetrain for the
**Mitsubishi Outlander**
that was revealed late last year will finally arrive in Australia during the first quarter of 2026.

With its new 22.7kWh battery pack, the 2026 Outlander PHEV is said to be good for 86km of tailpipe emissions-free driving under the WLTP standard or 103km under the more generous NEDC regime.

The outgoing car is equipped with a 20kWh unit, which is rated for 84km of NEDC electric range.

Mitsubishi Motors Australia makes no mention of the heat pump that's available overseas, nor has it provided any details about the 2026 PHEV model's drivetrain.

For overseas versions of the Outlander PHEV, the drivetrain is now rated at 225kW, up 40kW on today's model, likely due to the higher continuous output of the new battery pack.

As before, the drivetrain features a 85kW/255Nm motor at the front, and a 100kW/195Nm unit driving the rear wheels. Depending on the situation, the 100kW/203Nm 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine can either act a generator for the battery, or drive the front wheels directly.

Like petrol-only versions of the Outlander, the upgraded PHEV model now comes with an Australian-tuned suspension setup.

The 2026 Outlander PHEV will be available in four trims: ES, Aspire, Exceed, and Exceed Tourer. It appears the range-topping GSR, with its sportier looks and blacked out trim, has been removed from the range.

New features on the entry-level
**ES**
include redesigned front and rear bumpers, and fresh 18-inch alloy wheels. Like the petrol range, a 12.3-inch infotainment system with wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay is now standard across the range.

Other items on the ES include an eight-speaker Yamaha Premium sound system, cloth upholstery, a frameless self-dimming rear-view mirror, improved blind spot assist and lane departure avoidance systems, active cruise control linked to traffic sign recognition, and a 360-degree camera system.

Upgrade to the
**Aspire**
and there's a new 20-inch alloy wheel design, faux leather upholstery, heated steering wheel and front seats, lane-keep assist, traffic jam assist, and an improved wireless smartphone charger. A third row of seats, for a 5+2 layout, is now standard on the Aspire and up.

If you want real leather upholster, in either grey or black, you'll need to stump up for the
**Exceed.**
It also features aluminium pedals, a frameless digital rear-view mirror, and ventilated front seats.

The top-of-the-range
**Exceed Tourer**
gains a 12-speaker Yahama Ultimate sound system, Brick Brown semi-aniline leather upholstery, and massaging front seats.

Full specifications and pricing will be revealed closer to the updated Outlander PHEV's launch in 2026.
