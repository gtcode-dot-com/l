In March 2024,
**Mozilla**
said it was winding down its collaboration with
**Onerep**
— an identity protection service offered with the
**Firefox**
web browser that promises to remove users from hundreds of people-search sites — after KrebsOnSecurity revealed Onerep’s founder had created dozens of people-search services and was continuing to operate at least one of them. Sixteen months later, however, Mozilla is still promoting Onerep. This week, Mozilla announced its partnership with Onerep will officially end next month.

In
[a statement](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/monitor-plus-shutting-down)
published Tuesday, Mozilla said it will soon discontinue
**Monitor Plus**
, which offered data broker site scans and automated personal data removal from Onerep.

“We will continue to offer our free Monitor data breach service, which is integrated into Firefox’s credential manager, and we are focused on integrating more of our privacy and security experiences in Firefox, including our VPN, for free,” the advisory reads.

Mozilla said current Monitor Plus subscribers will retain full access through the wind-down period, which ends on Dec. 17, 2025. After that, those subscribers will automatically receive a prorated refund for the unused portion of their subscription.

“We explored several options to keep Monitor Plus going, but our high standards for vendors, and the realities of the data broker ecosystem made it challenging to consistently deliver the level of value and reliability we expect for our users,” Mozilla statement reads.

On March 14, 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published an investigation showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder
**Dimitiri Shelest**
[launched dozens of people-search services since 2010](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/)
, including a still-active data broker called Nuwber that sells background reports on people. Shelest released
[a lengthy statement](https://onerep.com/blog/official-onerep-update-following-article-by-krebs)
wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in
**Nuwber**
, a data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he launched Onerep.
