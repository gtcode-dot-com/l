  description: Researchers have demonstrated remotely controlling a wheelchair over
    Bluetooth. CISA has issued an advisory. CISA said the WHILL wheelchairs did not
    enforce authentication for Bluetooth connections, allowing an attacker who is
    in Bluetooth range of the targeted device to pair with it. The attacker could
    then control the wheelchair’s movements, override speed restrictions, and manipulate
    configuration profiles, all without requiring credentials or user interaction.
