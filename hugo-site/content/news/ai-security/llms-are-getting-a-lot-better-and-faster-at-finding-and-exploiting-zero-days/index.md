## LLMs are Getting a Lot Better and Faster at Finding and Exploiting Zero-Days

Security teams have been automating vulnerability discovery for years, investing heavily in fuzzing infrastructure and custom harnesses to find bugs at scale.

Opus 4.6 reads and reasons about code the way a human researcher would­—looking at past fixes to find similar bugs that weren’t addressed, spotting patterns that tend to cause problems, or understanding a piece of logic well enough to know exactly what input would break it. When we pointed Opus 4.6 at some of the most well-tested codebases (projects that have had fuzzers running against them for years,
> [accumulating millions of hours of CPU time](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/research/llms/target_generation/)

The details of how Claude Opus 4.6 found these zero-days is the interesting part—read the whole blog post.
