Earth Wind & Fire, Sublime, The Black Crowes and The Living End will share the stage with the New Zealand outfit across the Easter long weekend in Byron Bay, with the festival known for its folding chairs, camping and laid-back crowd set to return for another four-day fiesta.

For 2026, organisers of the iconic event said they have listened to feedback "loud and clear" via Facebook of new rules for patrons regarding camp chairs.

"At one point, it felt like we were hosting the Byron Bay Camping Chair Convention 2025," they said in the post from October.

"Rest assured, we're upgrading the site for 2026 so you can dance, groove & move without obstacles."

The comfy alternative way to enjoy a gig has proved popular with music lovers over fifty, who have embraced watching a procession of festival acts from the comfort of a camping chair.

Rather than banning camp chairs altogether, they have put some strategies in place so everyone can enjoy the show:

"Our main stage will have a bigger venue footprint, new seating zones, and undercover areas for campers and deck chairs - both indoor and outdoor," Bluesfest Festival Director Peter Noble said.

"Plus, we're adding more buses to more areas, responding directly to what our audience has asked for."

* No BYO camp chairs in the tents or walkways
* More seating provided across the festival site
* Designated chair zones with screens
* Separate kids trolley zones
* Larger tents for more comfort & views
* More public transport to and from site
* Expanded culture & arts offerings

New Zealand art rockers Split Enz will reform with Tim Finn, Neil Finn, Matt Eccles and James Milne to perform their first Australian show in 20 years, and their 50th anniversary.

Founded in 1990, Bluesfest is held at a farm just outside Byron Bay, and brings together a diverse range of music including blues, soul and rock. Famously, attendees are encouraged to bring folding chairs, which they can use in designated areas near each stage.

Early bird tickets are on sale now for the event from April 2 to 5, 2206. For more details, visit:
