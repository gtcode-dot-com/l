The discussion focused on assessing the progress and future strategies of digital development projects implemented by the institutions under the Ministry, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL), the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) and GovTech (Pvt) Ltd. It also aimed to identify challenges causing project delays and to take necessary policy and administrative decisions to address these issues.

Stressing the need to expedite the “Communication to the Village” initiative, the President highlighted the target of installing 500 new towers within three years.

President Dissanayake further instructed officials of the Department for Registration of Persons to take immediate steps to resolve delays in issuing National Identity Cards.

Attention was also drawn to expediting the Sri Lanka Unique Digital Identity (SLUDI) project, strengthening the administrative and operational framework of the Ministry, establishing a new Digital Economy Authority and developing the necessary human resources for a robust digital economy.
