A 21-year-old Swedish volunteer,

[, miraculously survived a lion attack during a horse safari](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15276773/Woman-21-bitten-neck-lion-dragged-horse-South-Africa-safari-miraculously-escapes.html)
in Tzaneen, South Africa, according to
*The Daily Mail*
. The incident occurred in October when Naemi, from Malmo, was assigned to ride at the back of the group for safety. Unbeknownst to the group, a young male lion was lurking in the undergrowth. As Naemi passed by, the lion sprang out, bit her in the neck, and dragged her from her horse.

The
[lion unexpectedly released Naemi](https://www.the-sun.com/news/15468250/ferocious-lion-drags-safari-tourist-horse-neck-broken-back/)
and disappeared into the savannah. She sustained severe injuries, including two broken vertebrae and spinal cord damage. Her colleagues quickly rushed her to a hospital in Tzaneen, where she also suffered a stroke and developed an infection in the bite wound. Despite these complications, Naemi was stabilized and flown back to Sweden for further treatment.

She

and may need surgery, though doctors are hopeful she can recover without it.

Despite the traumatic experience, Naemi plans to return to South Africa and participate in another safari, albeit with a vow never to ride at the back again. She believes the lion attacked out of curiosity, as she recognized it as a two-year-old that had been seen near the safari area before.
