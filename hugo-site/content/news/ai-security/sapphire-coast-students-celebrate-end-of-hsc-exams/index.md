SCAC Year 12 formal 2025. Pictures by Ben Smyth

Students studying physics, food technology and dance were sitting HSC exams right through until Friday afternoon, making SCAC's end-of-year formal the same evening a timely celebration of everyone's efforts and achievements.

Across 17 test days, close to 75,000 HSC students sat more than 400,000 exam sessions in 123 different subjects, running across more than 750 exam locations.

Marking was already well underway, with more than 6500 markers assessing responses from more than 1.2 million exam papers.

Students will receive their HSC results and ATAR on Thursday, December 18.

For anyone planning on university, applications submitted through the University Admissions Centre by November 27 will be considered in the main round of offers.

Applicants will still have until December 18 to finalise their preferences before offers are released on December 23.
