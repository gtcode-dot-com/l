# Introduction

I've recently been researching Pixel kernel exploitation and as part of this research I found myself with an excellent arbitrary write primitive…but without a KASLR leak. As necessity is the mother of all invention, on a hunch, I started researching the Linux kernel linear mapping.

# The Linux Linear Mapping

The linear mapping is a region in the kernel virtual address space that is a direct 1:1 unstructured representation of physical memory. Working with Jann, I learned how the kernel decided where to place this region in the virtual address space. To make it possible to analyze kernel internals on a rooted phone, Jann wrote a tool to call tracing BPF's privileged

BPF\_FUNC\_probe\_read\_kernel

helper, which by design permits arbitrary kernel reads. The code for this is available
[here](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/434208461)

. The linear mapping virtual address for a given physical address is calculated by the following macro:

#define



phys\_to\_virt(x)



((unsigned



long)((x)



-



PHYS\_OFFSET)



|



PAGE\_OFFSET)



On Arm64

PAGE\_OFFSET

is simply:



#define



VA\_BITS













(CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS)

#define



\_PAGE\_OFFSET(va)





(-(UL(1)



<<



(va)))

#define



PAGE\_OFFSET









(\_PAGE\_OFFSET(VA\_BITS))



As

CONFIG\_ARM64\_VA\_BITS

is 39 on Android, it’s easy to calculate

PAGE\_OFFSET

=

0xffffff8000000000

.

PHYS\_OFFSET

is calculated by:

extern



s64













memstart\_addr;

/\*



PHYS\_OFFSET



-



the



physical



address



of



the



start



of



memory.



\*/

#define



PHYS\_OFFSET









({



VM\_BUG\_ON(memstart\_addr



&



1);



memstart\_addr;



})



memstart\_addr

is an exported variable that can be looked up in

/proc/kallsyms

. Using Jann’s

bpf\_arb\_read

program, it’s easy to see what this value is:



tokay:/



#



grep



memstart



/proc/kallsyms

ffffffee6d3b2b20



D



memstart\_addr

ffffffee6d3f2f80



r



\_\_ksymtab\_memstart\_addr

ffffffee6dd86cc8



D



memstart\_offset\_seed

|........|

tokay:/data/local/tmp



#



This value (

0x80000000

) doesn’t look particularly random. In fact,

memstart\_addr



was

theoretically randomized on every boot, but in practice this hasn’t happened for a while on arm64. In fact as of commit
[1db780bafa4c](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/commit/?id=1db780bafa4c)

it’s no longer even theoretical - virtual address randomization of the linear map is no longer a supported feature in arm64 Linux kernel.



The systemic issue is that memory can (theoretically) be hot plugged in Linux and on Android because of

CONFIG\_MEMORY\_HOTPLUG=y

. This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of

theoretical

physical memory is far larger than the entire

possible

linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory. While it is not technically necessary to choose between memory hot-plugging support and linear map randomization, the Linux kernel developers
[decided](https://lore.kernel.org/all/CAMj1kXHXAYt0xLnx4=+qiCbnuF5U+9dzwnds1yd+vhTtpP5v3Q@mail.gmail.com/)

not to invest the engineering effort to implement memory hot-plugging in a way that preserves linear map randomization.



So we now know that

PHYS\_OFFSET

will always be

0x80000000

, and thusly, the

phys\_to\_virt

calculation becomes purely static - given any physical address, you can calculate the corresponding linear map virtual address by the following formula:

#define



phys\_to\_virt(x)



((unsigned



long)((x)



-



0x80000000)



|



0xffffff8000000000)

# Kernel physical address non-randomization

Compounding this issue, it also happens that on Pixel phones, the bootloader decompresses the kernel itself at the same physical address every boot:

0x80010000

.



tokay:/



#



grep



Kernel



/proc/iomem

[Theoretically, the bootloader can place the kernel at a random physical address every boot,](https://docs.kernel.org/arch/arm64/booting.html)

and many (but not all) other phones, such as the Samsung S25, do this. Unfortunately, Pixel phones are an example of a device that simply decompresses the kernel at a static physical address.

# Calculating static kernel virtual addresses

This means that we can statically calculate a kernel virtual address for any kernel .data entry. Here’s an example of me computing that linear map address for the

modprobe\_path

string in kernel .data on a Pixel 9:



tokay:/



# grep modprobe\_path /proc/kallsyms

So

modprobe\_path

will

always

be accessible at the kernel virtual address

0xffffff8001ff2398

, in addition to its normal mapping, even with KASLR enabled. In practice, on Pixel devices you can derive a valid virtual address for a kernel symbol by calculating its offset and simply adding a hardcoded static kernel base address of

0xffffff8000010000

.

In short, instead of breaking the KASLR slide, it is possible to just use

0xffffff8000010000

as a kernel base instead.



The linear mapping memory is even mapped rw for any kernel .data regions.

The only consolation that makes using this address slightly less effective than the traditional method of leaking the KASLR slide is that .text regions are not mapped executable - so an attacker cannot use this base for e.g. ROP gadgets or more generally PC control. But oftentimes, a Linux kernel attacker’s goal isn’t arbitrary code execution in kernel context anyway - arbitrary read-write is the more frequently desired primitive.

# Impact on devices with kernel physical address randomization



Even on devices where the kernel location

is

randomized in the physical address space, linear mapping non-randomization

still

softens the kernel considerably to attempts at exploitation. This is particularly because techniques that involve spraying memory (either kernel structures or even userland mmap’s!) can land at predictable physical addresses - and those physical addresses are easily referenceable in kernel virtual address space through the linear map. That potentially gives an attacker a methodology for placing kernel data structures or even simply attacker-controlled

userland

memory at a known

kernel

virtual address. I created a simple program that allocated (via mmap and page fault) a substantial quantity (~5 GB)  of physical memory on a Samsung S23, then used

/proc/pagemap

to create a list of which physical page frame numbers (pfns) were allocated. I ran this program 100 times (rebooting in between each time), then counted how often each pfn appeared across the 100 execution cycles. The set of pfns and their counts for how often they appeared were then converted into an image where each pfn is represented by a single pixel. The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way. A big thank you to Jann Horn for developing the tool to create this image from the data that I collected.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgbNbqq9k4MmeCHigBaD_hgBU91sCS1G-DtdOE8B_kcmRX84JNEAGtNEx6UcUpKSsho0f76hPkeFvuJhPpbyCe5_9_v_u8F5Ub_9Tu_xiwgJ5HCobHa-T57gewDh4mTK23Jz56rt4lbWRWuxMun2ISNrsfBGznA92pKLy4J2REgtHhi2AOHayxHGiWnJYA)



This data exemplifies the non-homogenous reliability of pfn allocation to userland mappings, albeit on a device that was only just rebooted. There are ranges of pfns that are allocated quite reliably, and other ranges that are quite unreliable (but still occasionally used). For example, here’s a range of pfns surrounding one of the pages that was allocated 100 times in a row. I suspect this sample is representative of the practical reliability of this technique for placing desired data at a known kernel address for at least a newly rebooted device.

While reliability may suffer on a device that hasn’t rebooted in some time, it remains high enough to be inviting to real-world attackers. Being able to place arbitrarily readable and writable data at a known kernel virtual address is a

powerful

exploitation primitive as an attacker can much more easily forge kernel data structures or objects and, for example, emplace pointers to those objects in heap sprays attacking UAF issues.

# The Prognosis

I reported these two separate issues,
[lack of linear map randomization](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/434208461)

, and
[kernel lands at static physical address in Pixel](https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/434269715)

, to the Linux kernel team and Google Pixel respectively. However both of these issues are considered intended behavior. While Pixel may introduce randomized physical kernel load addresses at some later point as a feature, there are no immediate plans to resolve the lack of randomization of the Linux kernel’s linear map on arm64.

# Conclusion

Three years ago,
[I wrote on the state of x86 KASLR](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2022/12/exploiting-CVE-2022-42703-bringing-back-the-stack-attack.html)

and noted how “it is probably time to accept that KASLR is no longer an effective mitigation against local attackers and to develop defensive code and mitigations that accept its limitations.” While it remains true that KASLR should not be trusted to prevent exploitation, particularly in local contexts, it is regrettable that the attitude around Linux KASLR is so fatalistic that putting in the engineering effort to preserve its remaining integrity is not considered to be worthwhile. The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Group have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios. In the future, we hope to see changes to the Linux kernel linear mapping and memory hot-plugging implementation to make this a less inviting target for attackers. Randomizing the location of the linear map in the virtual address space,
[increasing the entropy in physical page allocation](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e900a918b0984ec8f2eb150b8477a47b75d17692)

, and randomizing the location of the kernel in the physical address space are all concrete steps that can be taken that would improve the overall security posture of Android, the Linux kernel, and Pixel.
