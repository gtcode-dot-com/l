  description: The Department of Justice has indicted thirty-one people over the high-tech
    rigging of high-stakes poker games. In a typical legitimate poker game, a dealer
    uses a shuffling machine to shuffle the cards randomly before dealing them to
    all the players in a particular order. As set forth in the indictment, the rigged
    games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing
    the machines to read all the cards in the deck. Because the cards were always
    dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine
    which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to
    an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via
    cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred
    to as the “Quarterback” or “Driver.” The Quarterback then secretly signaled this
    information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other
    items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also
    participants in the scheme. Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in
    on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games
    against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of
    dollars at a time. The defendants used other cheating technology as well, such
    as a chip tray analyzer (essentially, a poker chip tray that also secretly read
    all cards using hidden cameras), an x-ray table that could read cards face down
    on the table, and special contact lenses or eyeglasses that could read pre-marked
    cards. ...
