Thousands of people attended Remembrance Day services across the country on Tuesday, pausing at 11am to mark the 107th anniversary of the armistice that ended fighting in World War I.

Hundreds of people turned out to Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance, braving the rain and wind.

Among them was Vietnam veteran Noel McLean, who served in the navy on HMAS Sydney, where his unit escorted army soldiers into combat.

"The people who paid the heaviest price were the army - boots on the ground. I didn't see any of that and in some ways, I'm fortunate," he told AAP.

"If they hadn't done what they've done, this would have been a very different country today."

The national service at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra was attended by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Opposition Leader Sussan Ley and senior Australian Defence Force officers.

Giving a speech at the war memorial, outgoing RSL National president and retired major general Greg Melick criticised defence spending levels, urging the nation to boost its ammunition and fuel reserves.

"Despite the fact that this nation has been involved in wars more than often not since Federation, I fear we remain complacent," he told the audience, which included top dignitaries.

"Our defence minister is keenly aware of the issues facing his portfolio, so the challenge before him is to convince his colleagues to rebalance our priorities, otherwise in future Remembrance Day ceremonies, we may well regret the conflict we didn't deter."

In Brisbane, Princess Anne visited Gallipoli Barracks to attend a service, where she lay a wreath and presented awards.

The ceremony capped the end of her four-day tour of Australia.

In Canberra, Vietnam veteran John Kearns, who served in the Battle of Coral-Balmoral, said the day reminded him of "very sad, but also funny memories".

On her day off, nurse Fiona visited Melbourne's shrine to pay her respects to the fallen heroes.

"This is an important thing for humans that you don't really want to forget," she said.

"A lot of people die and suffer, and their families too. Without them, we wouldn't have the peace that we have today."

Remembrance Day in 2025 also coincides with the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in 1945.

Mr Albanese said the nation remembered every young Australian denied the chance to grow old and the ones who returned home with physical and mental wounds.

"We remember every future lost and every future changed forever," he said.

"That is the heart of the pledge we hand from one generation to the next."

Ms Ley said the occasion honoured every Australian who has served in uniform and those who served the nation with distinction.

"Eighty years on from the end of the Second World War, we remember a generation whose courage and sacrifice secured peace for millions," she said.

"Their legacy lives on in the values of courage, duty and mateship that continue to define our Australian Defence Force today."
