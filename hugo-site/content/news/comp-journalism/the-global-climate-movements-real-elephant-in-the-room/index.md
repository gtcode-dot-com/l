Welcome to

behind one of the worst nuclear accidents in the United States? Litter is highly absorbent, so it is often used for the handling and disposal of radioactive liquids. But when workers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico decided to switch to an organic brand in 2014, it reacted with the nuclear waste and caused a barrel to explode. Enough radioactive material was dispersed throughout the facility to

### **Emissions Inversion**

The annual United Nations climate negotiation meeting, the Conference of the Parties (COP), ended last month. Unsurprisingly, the event
[was widely summarized](https://abcnews.go.com/International/cop30-delegates-agree-minute-deal-falls-short-expectations/story?id=127785289)
as disappointing. In a particularly apt metaphor for the U.N.’s dysfunction, a pavilion at the event
[caught fire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4iJBXI9CeQ)
. But what caught my eye was the inevitable post-summit blame directed at Republicans for global climate inaction. A
[*Politico*
piece](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/22/the-world-is-fractured-the-climate-talks-reflected-that-00666118)
about the COP stated (emphasis added), “U.S. President Donald Trump is the most obvious
*avatar for the geopolitical shifts*
confronting the talks.” Dear me, an
*avatar*
for the geopolitical shifts?

Hyperbole aside, there is plenty to dislike about Trump’s climate posture. But it’s not the reason for the COP’s many shortcomings. The global climate movement’s real weakness stems from negotiators’ desire to foist climate burdens on the United States while offering nothing in return. While
[*Politico*
noted](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/11/21/the-sad-sorry-state-of-cop-00665863)
that the absence of a U.S. delegation at the COP was an “elephant in the room,” the real elephant in the room is China’s surging emissions. Since 2005, the U.S. has cut greenhouse gas emissions more than any other nation, and if COP delegates want to deal seriously with Washington, they must reckon with the need for burden sharing.

As my fellow
**Dispatch Energy**
contributor Roger Pielke Jr.
[recently highlighted](https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/dispatch-energy/climate-change-paris-agreement-united-nations/)
, the U.N. and media outlets alike often incorrectly credit the Paris Agreement for a massive cut in projected emissions. The truth, Pielke explains, is that the initial emissions projections were wildly off-base, and the Paris Agreement has likely had almost no impact on the actual trajectory of emissions.

Similarly, data reveals a big disconnect between what is said at the COP and what is happening on the global stage. While
[Democrats](https://democrats-foreignaffairs.house.gov/2025/1/dems-call-on-trump-to-reverse-day-one-withdrawal-of-u-s-from-paris-climate-accords)
,
[foreign governments](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2025/767230/EPRS_ATA(2025)767230_EN.pdf)
, and
[academics](https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-news-that-the-united-states-has-withdrawn-from-the-paris-agreement-again/)
have criticized the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the truth is that from 2005 to 2019, we
[cut carbon dioxide emissions](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/international-emission-data-shows-united-states-leading-on-climate-and-developing-nations-increasing-emissions/)
more than every other developed nation
*combined.*
Even amid Trump’s purge of climate regulations during his first administration, strong evidence shows that
[competitive energy markets](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/market-gateways-not-the-epa-determine-power-sector-decarbonization/)
in the U.S. continue to drive greenhouse gas abatement.

This is in part because economic growth yields efficiency that in turn lowers emissions. So while climate-focused policies may lower emissions, they may do so at an economic cost, which forgoes the emission reductions that naturally come from a more energy-efficient economy. A good example of this phenomenon is the Obama administration’s
[Clean Power Plan](https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/fact-sheet-overview-clean-power-plan_.html)
. The limits on carbon pollution from power plants never took effect due to a Supreme Court ruling, but the U.S. nevertheless beat its emission targets
[*a decade early*](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/reductions-in-u-s-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-mostly-not-due-to-federal-regulation/)
primarily thanks to more efficient natural gas production. These results were delivered by the free market, not regulation, but had the framework been implemented, Democrats would have inevitably credited it.

Meanwhile, the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, China, has significantly increased its carbon footprint. From 2005 to 2019, for every metric ton of emission decline in the United States, China
[increased](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/international-emission-data-shows-united-states-leading-on-climate-and-developing-nations-increasing-emissions/)
its own emissions by 3.74 metric tons.

China
[accounts for](https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-information-overview/consumption)
more than half of the world’s coal use. And while Beijing’s construction of renewable-energy power plants and electric vehicles is

[praised](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/climate/china-climate-leadership-belem-cop30.html)
in the media, China has also been rapidly building new coal power plants, hitting a
[10-year high](https://www.carbonbrief.org/chinas-construction-of-new-coal-power-plants-reached-10-year-high-in-2024/)
for new coal plant construction last year. Call me crazy, but I’m doubtful China is investing billions of dollars into new coal projects just to retire them soon. (Though
[some on the left](https://www.americanprogress.org/press/release-chinese-coal-powered-plants-much-cleaner-u-s-plants-better-climate-change/)
argue that
*their*
coal plants are better than
*ours,*
so we shouldn’t worry about their massive share of emissions.) Ultimately, blaming Republicans for climate woes while praising China stands at odds with observable truth.

Given this context, Republican frustration with the dynamics of global climate policy is understandable. In a normal world, the nations making the most progress toward resolving a collective action problem would be praised while those falling behind would be chastised. But the dynamic is inverted for climate issues, and a reluctance to acknowledge the necessity of burden sharing is off-putting to many Republican policymakers.

The climate strategy of making demands of the United States and the West while giving the rest of the world a pass is not a new phenomenon—before the Paris Agreement, there was the 1997
[Kyoto Protocol](https://treaties.un.org/pages/viewdetails.aspx?src=treaty&mtdsg_no=xxvii-7-a&chapter=27&clang=_en)
(KP). The KP was the first major international climate treaty, and unlike the Paris Agreement, it set out firm targets for participants to meet. But the protocol did not seek equal commitments from all participants; instead, it divided the world into wealthy industrialized nations and poorer developing ones. Only the wealthy nations, like the United States, had to meet certain obligations, while other countries, like China, had none. Emission targets were pegged to 1990 levels, so former Soviet states met them by default due to the Soviet Union’s industrial collapse. The KP, put simply, asked Western nations to commit to climate action while exempting U.S. rivals. Unsurprisingly, the Senate never ratified the protocol, and when President George W. Bush later declined to participate, the
*Guardian*
[featured the headline](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2001/mar/29/globalwarming.usnews)
: “Bush kills global warming treaty.”

The Paris Agreement was supposed to rectify these problems by asking nations to set their own voluntary targets. One might think this could have been an opportunity for the U.S. to negotiate directly with other big emitters for a reciprocal agreement. Yet what President Barack Obama revealed in a 2015
[joint statement](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/u-s-china-joint-presidential-statement-on-climate-change-the-road-to-paris-and-beyond/)
with China was that the United States would cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent, and China would agree to “peak” emissions by 2030. This deal amounted to “I’ll gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today,” but at the time was
[praised as groundbreaking](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/u-s-china-climate-announcements-lay-foundation-for-success-in-paris/)
.

Recognizing that this deal would never pass muster with the then-Republican-held Senate, the Paris Agreement was crafted so the administration could claim that it
[did not require ratification](https://www.heritage.org/environment/commentary/obama-sidesteps-senate-approval-paris-agreement)
. Some legal scholars even
[argued](https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/1953/)
that the international provision in the Clean Air Act gave Obama all the authority he needed to set any target he wanted under the Paris Agreement and regulate to meet it, circumventing Congress entirely. Unsurprisingly, fear of that regulatory tactic was what prompted Republicans to announce plans to
[withdraw](https://www.eenews.net/articles/wheeler-obscure-air-provision-behind-paris-withdrawal/)
from the Paris Agreement the first time back in 2017.

This U-turn should have taught future presidents that they need to win over the public if they want international climate accords to have staying power. Yet when it was President Joe Biden’s turn in 2021, he largely pursued the same approach as Obama, making big promises while getting nothing in return from other global emitters.
[My own analysis](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/are-other-countries-reciprocating-u-s-climate-promises/)
of his administration’s target under the Paris Agreement found that of all the promised cuts from new pledges that year, 71 percent of the reduced emissions would have come only from the United States.

In short, it is foolish to expect Republicans who were sidelined from climate negotiations and policymaking under two administrations to uphold Democrat-championed climate deals. But it’s particularly so given those administrations’ reluctance to push other countries to share in their ambitious emissions reduction goals.

To be clear, I have
[defended the Paris Agreement](https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/paris-agreement-stay-not-stay/)
. It has potential as a negotiating tool that can circumvent the conventional barriers to global climate treaties and secure agreements that advance the interests of the United States. But the “elephant in the room” is not the reluctance of a large share of Americans to blindly support poorly negotiated emissions targets. It’s that nations like
[China, Russia, and India](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/international-emissions-trends-and-how-this-should-inform-u-s-climate-policy/)
are given a pass for their dismal climate performance.

It wasn’t long ago that even climate hawks like John Kerry
[expressed frustration](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366)
with the COP’s direction when it started focusing less on emissions abatement and more on ideas like “climate reparations.” And while Beijing is being praised for
[potentially peaking](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-co2-emissions-have-now-been-flat-or-falling-for-18-months/)
its emissions “early,” China’s projected 2025 emissions are about
[20 percent higher](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/china/)
than when it made the joint statement with Obama. Simply put, if COP delegates want more climate action from the United States, they must reckon with the need for reciprocity.

I applaud the intent of the COP, and I’ve
[defended](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/low-energy-fridays-should-we-stay-in-the-uns-climate-convention/)
the United States’ continued involvement in it. But climate hawks should be honest with themselves: Trump’s climate denial is

### **Policy Watch**

* One of the most significant bipartisan permitting bills in Congress, the SPEED Act, took another step closer to becoming law last month. The House Natural Resources Committee
  [voted to advance](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/4776/all-actions)
  the legislation on a bipartisan (though mostly Republican-led) vote of 25-18. The bill seeks to simplify environmental reviews for federal permits and require public interest groups to participate in public comment periods before litigating permits. The legislation must now survive a vote on the House floor before making its way to the Senate.
* Comments have closed on
  [the proposed repeal](https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/rulemaking-notices-ghg-reporting)
  of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The initiative, which was established in 2009, requires facilities that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year to monitor and report emissions to the federal government. The program was expanded considerably in 2024 to facilitate compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act’s methane fee, but with the
  [10-year delay](https://www.taxpayer.net/energy-natural-resources/big-beautiful-bill-delays-commonsense-fee-on-wasted-methane/)
  of that fee under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the current administration argues that there is no need for the program. Those in favor of ending the program argue that lower reporting costs will save Americans money, while those opposed argue that there may be
  [unintended consequences](https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/11/19/biden_epa_official_trumps_epa_is_knee-capping_us_energy_dominance_1148212.html)
  , like U.S. energy exporters to Europe having to comply with foreign reporting programs.

### **Innovation Spotlight**

* Carbon dioxide removal company Charm Industrial has secured its first aviation deal, according to
  [a report](https://www.axios.com/2025/11/14/boeing-carbon-removal-charm-industrial-startup)
  by
  *Axios*
  . The method of carbon dioxide removal is to turn biomass produced from forest management into a substance called biochar. The process involves taking organic materials that would normally decompose and release greenhouse gases and using pyrolysis to make them into an inert substance similar to charcoal. The effect is that the newly formed biochar traps the carbon dioxide that the plant matter had absorbed when alive and prevents its re-release into the atmosphere. The biochar is then used for soil fertilization, and the avoided greenhouse gases from decomposition are credited to an investor. Under the deal, Boeing will pay for enough biochar to effectively “remove” 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The deal reflects a significant private sector interest in paying for more complex—but more certain—methods of abating greenhouse gas emissions to appeal to their customers.
* [A lifespan for plastics](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2506104-plastic-can-be-programmed-to-have-a-lifespan-of-days-months-or-years/)
  ? New research from Rutgers University is developing a method of creating plastics that have set lifespans of days, months, or years before breaking down into base components. Plastic is chemically composed of long polymer chains, and the Rutgers researchers hypothesize that the similar shape of these chains to organic ones like DNA will enable them to engineer plastics that can break down like natural materials.

* Regardless of what the politicians say, there’s no getting around the fact that many Americans are still feeling a squeeze on the cost of living.
  [For
  *National Review*](https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/you-cant-spin-peoples-perceptions-of-their-own-finances/)
  , Jim Geraghty unpacks the sustained high costs of gasoline as a segue to the broader issue that most Americans are barely keeping up with inflation, arguing that politicians need both a better strategy and message.
* Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? While many people point to the energy demands of AI data centers, Michael Giberson of the R Street Institute
  [explains that it is more complicated](https://www.rstreet.org/commentary/low-energy-fridays-why-are-electricity-rates-rising/)
  than that. AI-driven demand may be rising, but ironically, states with rising electricity consumption have lower rates. The real culprit, Giberson explains, is the costs of transmission. Everywhere in the country, utilities are trying to build more transmission to connect customers to lower-cost generation, but not all areas have an equal number of customers to absorb the costs of new transmission. Because electricity bills are comprised of both transmission and generation costs, customers in regions with fewer customers and less demand growth end up with lopsided transmission costs even if their generation costs are low. “The data show a clear trend: States with growing consumption tend to have lower rates. This effect may explain why there’s no clear connection between growing data center power consumption in states and consumer rates in national data—at least not yet,” he writes. “For example, Virginia (the state with the largest concentration of data centers) continues to have rates below the national average.”
