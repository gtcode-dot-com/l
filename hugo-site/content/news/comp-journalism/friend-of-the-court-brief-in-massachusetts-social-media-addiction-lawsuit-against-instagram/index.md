Push notifications let Meta communicate information directly to its users. Infinite scroll lets Meta communicate information in a particular way. "[L]ike" buttons are visual elements that Meta communicates to users, and means for users to communicate information back to Meta. By attacking Meta's choices about how to communicate, the Commonwealth "prevents a platform from compiling the third-party speech it wants in the way it wants, and thus from offering the expressive product that most reflects its own views and priorities."

Br. 46, and its chosen design features. The Commonwealth characterizes Meta's design features as "independent of content" and therefore not within

> *Id.*
> at 47.

> But this is a false distinction. Just as Meta may curate content by expressing disapproval through its content moderation policies, Meta may approve of and encourage speech through its design features. For example, rather than expressly policing or prohibiting politically biased content, Meta could implement a "community note" feature allowing users to flag and respond to factual claims. Though a "community note" feature operates as a design feature rather than an express policy from Meta, it might function more effectively in fostering Meta's favored forms of speech. Similarly, the "like" function is a design feature that helps shape the content of Meta products, by adding extra information to each post (the number of likes), by encouraging users to post popular content that draws more likes, and by encouraging users to read more popular content that has drawn more likes.
>
> Even if such editorial choices were not necessarily treated as communicative themselves, they are protected under the First Amendment because they are decisions about how to effectively present and distribute speech. A performer may decide to use sound amplification to reach a larger group of listeners.

> *Rock Against Racism*
> , 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (treating sound-amplification regulation as a speech restriction, albeit one that may be content-neutral and subject to intermediate scrutiny). Likewise, a speaker may choose to canvass door-to-door rather than using billboards or mass mailings,

>
> **[II.] Social media users are entitled to First Amendment protections against governmental restrictions on communicative features a social media platform may offer**
>
> The changes that the Commonwealth demands that Meta impose would also operate as restrictions on users' ability to speak. The "like" feature enables users to convey speech with a certain content: It "literally causes to be published the statement that the [u]ser 'likes' something, which is itself a substantive statement."

> at 307-08 (Brennan, J., concurring) (stressing that it is not clear whether the First Amendment protects "political propaganda prepared and printed abroad by or on behalf of a foreign government," but concluding that the law was unconstitutional because it violated the recipients' "right to receive" information, regardless of the senders' rights to speak).} Like the "protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them," Meta's chosen design features "communicate ideas" to users "through features distinctive to the medium."
> *Brown*
> , 564 U.S. at 790. For example, "likes" signal to a user the approval of others. Push notifications bring platform speech to a user's attention. Removing or limiting these features makes it harder for users to exercise their right to receive information.
>
> Likewise, infinite scroll and auto-play make it easier for users to see material. They also make the browsing experience more exciting and thus lead the user to want to keep browsing; this, too, is a protected form of editorial expression. Authors of serialized fiction (print or visual) often use cliffhangers to keep people coming back to the next episode, and creators in every medium have long used promises of interesting future content if only the listener will "stay tuned."
>
> To be sure, infinite scroll and auto-play only make it slightly easier for users to keep browsing, since even without these features a user could just get more posts or see videos simply by clicking. But by the same token, any restrictions on infinite scroll and auto-play would likewise at most slightly (and hypothetically) serve whatever interests the Commonwealth is trying to serve by imposing such restrictions. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized that, even under intermediate scrutiny, a restriction is unconstitutional to the extent that it "provides only the most limited incremental support for the interest asserted" and thus only a "marginal degree of protection."

To assess the unfairness claim under M.G.L. ch. 93A, the Superior Court considered whether "the risks of the platform outweigh its benefits" and whether Meta's design decisions were "unreasonable." Mem. & Order 23 (cleaned up), Meta Br. 84. This is the very sort of risk-benefit and reasonableness analysis called for in a negligence case.

The court concluded that "liability may exist for tortious conduct in the form of speech" only when the speech falls within one of the "narrowly defined" "recognized exceptions to First Amendment protection," such as incitement.

>
> Nor is this First Amendment protection for speech lost even if a viewer or listener does something seriously harmful to third parties in a way that was in part caused by the speech. Thus, for instance, when plaintiffs claimed that a video game helped lead a 14-year-old player to commit murder, on the theory that defendants acted "negligently" and "communicated . . . a disregard for human life and an endorsement of violence," the First Amendment precluded such liability.

> This makes sense. Allowing negligence claims based on otherwise protected speech—speech that does not fall within one of the narrow First Amendmentexceptions—"would invariably lead to self-censorship by broadcasters in order to remove any matter that may . . . lead to a law suit."
> *DeFilippo*
> , 446 A.2d at 1041. This would in turn violate defendants' "right to make their own programming decisions" (even when the defendants are broadcasters, and thus seen as having a more "limited" First Amendment right than other speakers).

> The cost-benefit balancing at the heart of a negligence claim is also too vague to be constitutionally permissible. "Crucial to the safeguard of strict scrutiny" required in First Amendment cases "is that we have a clear limitation, articulated in the legislative statute or an administrative regulation, to evaluate."
> *James*
> , 300 F.3d at 697. No such clear limitation is present when a factfinder "evaluating [plaintiff's] claim of negligence would ask whether the defendants took efficient precautions . . . that would be less expensive than the amount of the loss."
> *Id.*
>
> The Commonwealth's negligence claim is not distinguishable from the preceding cases on the basis that it targets "design" rather than "content." The First Amendment protects choices about how to present content, not just the content itself.
> *See Ward*
> , 491 U.S. at 791 (recognizing the volume of speech as presumptively protected);
> *Watchtower*
> , 536 U.S. at 164-65 (recognizing the means of delivering speech, canvassing, as presumptively protected). Social media platforms make the very same choices when deciding what design features to offer, which requires that even content-neutral restrictions on these choices must be judged at least under intermediate scrutiny.
>
> Of course, the Commonwealth has broad authority over purely commercial behavior that does not involve speech. "Laws that target real-world commercial activity need not fear First Amendment scrutiny. Such run-of-the-mill economic regulations will continue to be assessed under rational-basis review."
> *Dana's R.R. Supply*
> v
> *. Att'y Gen., Fla.*
> , 807 F.3d 1235, 1251 (11th Cir. 2015). But this case does not concern a run-of-the-mill economic regulation. This case concerns a regulation of the content and presentation of speech. In such a situation, the government may not "criminaliz[e] speech" unless the speech falls within a First Amendment exception or the speech restriction otherwise passes heightened scrutiny.
> *Id.*
> As the cases cited above show, the same heightened scrutiny must apply to civil liability for such speech, too.
>
> **[IV.] Companies' views about the alleged harm and value of their speech products are entitled to full First Amendment protection**
>
> The Commonwealth is seeking to prevent Meta from opining on the state of the evidence concerning addiction and mental health stemming from the content and presentation of speech on Meta's platforms. In fact, the Commonwealth argues that Meta must affirmatively warn about a risk whose existence the company vehemently disputes. Ordinarily, the First Amendment provides "less protection to commercial speech" than it does to noncommercial speech.
> *See Bolger*
> , 463 U.S. at 64. But "a different conclusion may be appropriate in a case where the [commercial speech] advertises an activity itself protected by the First Amendment."

The same logic applies to statements by speech producers that express controversial opinions about their speech products' merits.
>
> As discussed in the preceding Parts, Instagram, like a book, consists of fully protected speech—both the speech of users and the expressive curation and layout decisions of Meta. Just as the creators and distributors of films, books, newspapers, and the like are entitled to express their opinions that their works are valuable rather than harmful, Meta is entitled to do the same without that becoming restrictable commercial speech, contrary to the Commonwealth's assertion in Count Two.
>
> Whether material is "safe[]" for minors, Mem. & Order 24, Meta Br. 85, is a hotly debated topic, as to films, books, music, social media platforms, and other speech products. Different people have sharply different opinions on these questions. All people and organizations, including the distributors of the speech, must be fully free to express those opinions.

Likewise, the publishers of

> or the operators of the platform must have the same right. The same is true with regard to statements about whether the book publishers or social media platforms "prioritize the safety and well-being of [their] young users [or readers] over profits," Mem. & Order 4, Meta Br. 65, or statements disputing whether some expressive work is so appealingly designed as to be "addictive,"

> To be sure, the government may sometimes regulate advertisements for protected speech similarly to other advertisements, as long as the regulation is essentially content-neutral (setting aside the regulation's drawing a commercial/noncommercial speech line). For example, consider a billboard ordinance that allows "political, ideological or other noncommercial message[s]" on billboards,

>
> Nor can the Commonwealth's case be saved by arguing that Meta "created an over-all misleading impression through failure to disclose material information," Mem. & Order 24, Meta Br. 85. Meta has no legal duty to "disclose" hotly-contested claims about whether Instagram is harmful to children—again, just as book publishers, filmmakers, or music distributors have no duty to disclose such claims about their books, films, or music (at least unless the speech falls within a First Amendment exception).

> If at some point the Commonwealth's claims about the alleged harms of various social media features (or of social media as a whole) are established to be factual and noncontroversial, the government might be able to require social media platforms to acknowledge such harms in their advertisements. But just as Meta cannot be prevented from expressing controversial opinions about its speech products under the First Amendment, it cannot be mandated to disclose non-factual or controversial claims about its products either.
>
> **CONCLUSION**
>
> The Commonwealth claims the power to regulate a social media platform's design decisions concerning where, when, and how speech is communicated—and in the case of "likes," what speech is communicated. But the First Amendment provides protections against speech-based negligence claims, as this Court and other courts have recognized.
