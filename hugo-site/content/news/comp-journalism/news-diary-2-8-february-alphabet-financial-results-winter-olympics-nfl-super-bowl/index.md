This week features a wave of financial results to be released from major multinational and media companies, including Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, the New York Times and News Corp, the owner of The Sun and The Times.

It’s also a big week in sport: the Winter Olympics begin in Milan on Friday, followed on Saturday by cricket’s T20 World Cup and rugby’s Six Nations. The week then closes with the Super Bowl, the NFL’s annual championship game in the US, as the Seattle Seahawks take on the New England Patriots.

One to watch out for: the Government is due to publish its National Cancer Plan this week. While a firm date hasn’t been announced yet, the government has in the past used World Cancer Day (4 February) to promote cancer-related policy announcements.
