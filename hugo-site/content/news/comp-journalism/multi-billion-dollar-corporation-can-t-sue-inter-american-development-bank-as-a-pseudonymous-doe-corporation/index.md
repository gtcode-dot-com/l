>
> This analysis applies perfectly in this case. A business corporation is suing a multigovernmental organization, the Inter-American Development Bank. Given the nature of the allegations and the law firm hired to litigate the case, the corporation is likely wealthy and important. So is the Bank, which has received billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars, and over which the U.S. government exercises 30% voting control.
>
> The corporation is claiming that the Bank has acted improperly, in violation of the Bank's own rules. The Bank has apparently claimed that the corporation has acted improperly. The corporation is now seeking to have the case resolved in federal court, using U.S. taxpayer resources.
>
> Following the normal course of litigation in American courts, where the corporations would sue under their own names, the public would be able to monitor what is happening. Journalists, researchers, activists, and others could find information about the corporation. They could determine whether there had been other controversies involving the corporation in general, or having to do with the Commercial Project Agreement (Compl. ¶ 3, App. 5) in particular.
>
> They could search for any related news stories, any related government documents, or any related court filings in other cases. They could interview the corporation's past and current employees, or employees of the corporation's past and current business partners. They could do all the research that normal media, academic, and activist commentary would normally include.
>
> Yet Doe Corporations want this case litigated in secret. Right now, they wants to conceal their own names. And if they prevail on that, then they will likely also need to seal or redact a massive amount of information in future filings that would disclose their identities. Eugene Volokh,
> *The Law of Pseudonymous Litigation*
> , 73 Hastings L.J. 1353, 1372-75 (2022) (discussing how "maintaining pseudonymity may require redacting or sealing documents filed in court").
>
> As this Court predicted in
> *Hill*
> , concealing "the identity of parties" would make it harder "for citizens to investigate" whether the judicial process was properly proceeding. It would "promote[] the appearance of [un]fairness." "Secrecy" would "breed[] suspicion, and so some may believe that a party's name was masked as a means of suppressing inconvenient facts and that the court was either asleep at the wheel or complicit in the cover up."
> *Hill*
> , 141 F.4th at 293 (cleaned up).
>
> To be sure, anyone can understand why Doe Corporations would want to litigate this case pseudonymously: Publicly discussing their allegations against the Bank—which of course relate to the Bank's allegations against them—would cause them reputational harm. But that is true in a vast range of legal disputes. Nearly every dispute involves reputation-damaging allegations against a defendant, and very many involve reputation-damaging allegations against a plaintiff.
>
> This is why many federal appellate courts have concluded that avoiding the risk of reputational, professional, and economic harm is not an adequate basis for pseudonymity (though the risk of physical and mental harm might be).
> *See infra*
> pp. 10-11. Ruling otherwise would risk reversing the presumption of openness that this Court has repeatedly reaffirmed.

> In light of the general presumption against pseudonymity and the particular significance of the allegations in this case, this Court should conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Doe Corporations' requests to proceed pseudonymously.

The reference to "preserv[ing] privacy in a matter of [a] sensitive and highly personal nature" under factor one is not relevant here: As the phrase "highly personal" suggests, "[t]hat factor commonly involves intimate issues such as sexual activities, reproductive rights, bodily autonomy, medical concerns, or the identity of abused minors," not corporate business interests that "bear no resemblance to those types of intimate or sensitive personal information."
> *Sealed Case II*

After all, the five-factor test calls on courts to strongly weigh the public's "interests in full disclosure" and not just the litigant's "interest in anonymity."

By hampering the public's ability to "evaluate the nature of the claims raised and the interests at stake, to assess the real-world aftermath of a suit and to determine for themselves whether justice was done," rampant pseudonymity would prevent citizens from "investigat[ing] the abuses of the judicial process."

But the District Court was correct in at least labeling such "reputational concerns" as "comparatively lesser" than the concerns that would justify pseudonymity, June 30 Order, App. 42.

The Bank is a multigovernmental organization, chartered to "contribute to the acceleration of the process of economic and social development of the regional development member countries." App. 9. It was established in the United States by an Act of Congress. Inter-American Development Bank Act, Pub. L. No. 86-147, 73 Stat. 299 (1959).

> *Hill*
> , 141 F.4th at 298; July 30 Order, App. 41. Though the claim before this Court is a contractual dispute, the dispute is rooted in Doe Corporations' argument that the Bank violated its charter when it initiated its enforcement proceedings and assumed "police power untethered to any source of authority." Compl. ¶ 2, App. 4. Arguing that "[t]he Charter grants the IDB carefully circumscribed enforcement authority,"
> *id*
> . at 13, Doe Corporations also ask the court to "confirm fundamental limitations on the IDB's power," including its power to enforce sanctions for precontractual conduct,

> The Court must thus interpret the Bank's charter to determine whether it provides authority to enforce the sanctions challenged by Doe Corporations:
>
> > Plaintiffs' challenge is not grounded in their specific circumstances or limited to individualized relief; as they explain, they seek "to resolve questions of law—including those concerning the IDB's immunity and compliance with contractual duties—on an undisputed factual record." Because their "arguments would clearly apply beyond [their] case," this factor weighs against pseudonymity.

> May 14 Order, App. 36
> *.*
> Since the Bank's sanctioning authority is in part a means of preserving Bank funds, Doe Corporations' arguments potentially affect the Bank's mechanisms for protecting funds that U.S. taxpayers have committed to the Bank, not just in projects involving Doe Corporations but in other projects as well. And Doe Corporations' request for a gag order on the Bank (see Compl. relief ¶¶ 2, 4, App. 30; Mot. for Prelim. Inj., discussed in Appellants' Br. 15) raises independent and important questions about when it is proper for a federal court to restrict disclosures by an inter-governmental organization such as the Bank.
>
> Yet, despite the enormous amount of money controlled by the Bank and the influence it wields—and despite the potentially controversial nature of the injunction that Doe Corporations seek—neither the public nor the press currently know any specific details about this lawsuit or the companies that brought it.

> 8. pretty much anything else about Doe Corporations.
>
> The public and the press do not know this information now. If pseudonymity is allowed, they will not learn this information from future filings, which would presumably be largely sealed in order to maintain the pseudonymity. The public and the press will not be able to figure it out from interviews with Doe Corporations' employees or former employees, since no-one will know whom to ask.

And that is especially troubling in a matter like this one, which may involve many millions of dollars; Doe Corporations' allegations of impropriety on the Bank's part; and the Bank's allegations of impropriety on the part of companies that seek Bank funds (and thus, indirectly, American taxpayer funds).

> Doe Corporations do not dispute the lower court's use of the five-factor standard applied by the district court; they dispute the court's application of the criteria. Appellant's Br. 29-30. The "application of … criteria" to the facts of a particular case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.
> *Hill*
> , 141 F.4th at 295 (citing

> Doe Corporations argue that the lower court erred by (a) failing to consider reputational or economic harm under the retaliatory physical or mental harm factor (factor two) and (b) finding that litigation against government entity supported disclosure (factor four). Appellant's Br. 46-48. But not considering reputational harm to be an adequate substitute for physical or mental harm squarely aligns with the cases discussed at pp. 10-11. And

>
> Moreover, as shown
> *supra*
> Part II, the public's interest in monitoring litigation against the Bank is particularly substantial. The District Court's finding that the public had an "intensified" interest in this case, July 30 Order, App. 42, was, at the very least, reasonable. So was concluding that the first and fifth factors do not "outweigh the public's presumptive and substantial interest in learning their identities." May 14 Order, App. 33;

>
> **Conclusion**
>
> Doe Corporations have come to a public federal courtroom, suing a Bank that is in large part funded by American taxpayer money, and that is in large part controlled by the U.S. government. Doe Corporations are alleging improper conduct by the Bank, and the Bank has apparently itself alleged improper conduct by Doe Corporations. This is the sort of litigation that Americans are generally entitled to observe and monitor, usually through the intermediaries of journalists, researchers, and activists who would gather and publish information about the litigation and the litigants.
>
> Yet Doe Corporations seek to litigate the matter with their names concealed. If that is allowed, many more facts will have to be concealed as well. And their argument for the concealment—the risk of reputational and economic harm—is the sort of argument that a vast range of other litigants can make.
