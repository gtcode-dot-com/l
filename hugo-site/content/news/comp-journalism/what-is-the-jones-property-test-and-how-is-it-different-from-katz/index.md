The
*[Washington University Law Review](https://wustllawreview.org/)*
has just published my new article,
["The Two Tests of Search Law: What Is the
*Jones*
Test, and What Does That Say About
*Katz*
?"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5129549)
Here's the abstract:

> Fourth Amendment law has two "search" tests: The
> *Katz*
> privacy test and the
> *Jones*
> property test. Lower courts are not sure what the difference is between them, however, or whether the
> *Jones*
> test is based on trespass law or the mechanics of physical intrusion. The result is a remarkable conceptual uncertainty in Fourth Amendment law. Every lower court recites that there are two search tests, but no one knows what one test means or how it relates to the other.
>
> This Article argues that the
> *Jones*
> test hinges on physical intrusion, not trespass law. Jones claimed to restore a pre-
> *Katz*
> search test, and a close look at litigation both before
> *Katz*
> and after Jones shows an unbroken line adopting an intrusion standard and (where it has arisen) rejecting a trespass standard. This understanding of
> *Jones*
> is not only historically correct, but also normatively important. How we understand
> *Jones*
> tells us how to understand
> *Katz*
> . The intrusion approach offers an accurate interpretation of both tests that shows the continuing importance of
> *Katz*
> .

I had a lot of fun nerding out on the often-forgotten case of
[*Silverman v. United States*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9111706507320172303&q=365+U.S.+505+(1961)&hl=en&as_sdt=2006&authuser=1)
(1961) when researching this article.
*Silverman*
is all but ignored these days, but I think it shouldn't be: You can't understand what
*Katz*
did in 1967, or what
*Jones*
did in 2012 in returning to pre-
*Katz*
law, without understanding what
*Silverman*
did (and didn't do) in 1961. Once you understand
*Silverman*
, what happened later fairly neatly falls into place, I think.
