More than 3,000 job cuts were recorded in the journalism industry in the UK and US in 2025 according to Press Gazette’s rolling updates.

The total estimated number of redundancies in the UK and US throughout 2025 (based on company announcements and media reports) was at least 3,248. Scroll down
[or click here](#h-journalism-job-cuts-in-2025-full-list)
for full information about the job cuts included in this tally.

This means job cuts in 2025
[were 16% lower than in 2024](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2024/)
and 59% down
[compared to 2023](https://pressgazette.co.uk/media_business/journalism-job-cuts-2023/)
(although around 2,000 Canadian jobs were also included in that year’s tally. Removing them would make it a 46% decline compared to 2023).

The biggest month in 2025 for job cuts was
[January](#h-january-2025-journalism-job-cuts)
(at least 939) followed by
[October](#h-october-2025-journalism-job-cuts)
(499) and
[May](#h-may-2025-journalism-job-cuts)
(482). The quietest time was
[August](#h-august-2025-journalism-job-cuts)
(15).

About 70% of the journalism job cuts recorded in Press Gazette’s tally in 2025 were in the US, with 30% in the UK. Similarly in 2024 at least three-quarters of job losses were in the US.

These figures mainly cover editorial roles but do include some wider cuts outside the newsrooms, for example in product and commercial teams.

Our estimate is mainly based on announced cutbacks at larger companies, which means the true figure will likely be much higher.

People Inc, the biggest consumer publisher in the US, made the most media job cuts in 2025 with one round of 143 layoffs in January and a further 226 losses in October. This followed layoffs of about 53 people in November 2024.

In January (when the publisher was still known as Dotdash Meredith),
[chief executive Neil Vogel told staff the publisher would be investing](#h-dotdash-meredith-143-people)
in growth areas such as entertainment, food and adtech arm D/Cipher.

[Then in October Vogel said](#h-people-inc-226-jobs)
: “Today’s actions are a difficult but necessary step as we continue to evolve our business and prioritise investments that will help us continue to thrive in today’s media environment…

“Over the last year, we’ve hired 320 people to help us drive growth in new areas and we currently have over 40 open roles that will infuse new expertise and capabilities across our brands and teams.”

People Inc was followed by UK broadcaster ITV which said in May it would make more than 220 redundancies across news, current affairs and other daytime scheduling including at Good Morning Britain (which is now being
[produced by ITV News producer ITN instead of ITV itself](https://pressgazette.co.uk/the-wire/media-jobs-uk-news/good-morning-britain-editor-daniel-robinson/)
), Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women. It said it would reinvest in more streaming-friendly types of programmes such as drama and sport.

ABC News Group and CNN both made about 200 job cuts during 2025.

# Journalism job cuts in 2025: Full list

## December 2025 journalism job cuts

*12 December:*
Jobs have been cut at Penske Media titles Billboard, Variety and Rolling Stone,
[as reported by The Wrap.](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/wave-layoffs-hit-billboard-penske-232904635.html)

Former Billboard executive editor Frank DiGiacomo
[later wrote on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7413954745972756480/)
: “After 11 years working at the music industry trade Billboard, my position was eliminated in December. After a year of watching AI eat into media traffic, I’m not shocked, but I am saddened.”

The Wrap cited five people affected at Billboard, including two editors at large, as well as two people each at Variety and Rolling Stone.

It
[follows the loss](#h-rolling-stone-at-least-three)
of at least three roles at Rolling Stone in September.

Rolling Stone senior writer
[Brittany Spanos](https://x.com/ohheybrittany/status/1998066814891266416)
wrote on X on 8 December that she was “laid off” after 11 years at the title and noted that she had published three cover stories for the brand and hosted its first live interview event in 2025.

Rolling Stone writer Andre Gee said in a
[fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/offering-support-after-rolling-stone-layoff)
to cover his upcoming expenses: “Last week, after three years at Rolling Stone, I was unexpectedly laid off. Apparently,
[Rolling Stone’s recent merger with Vibe](https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/)
eliminated the need for my position. This termination leaves me in immediate peril. My salary was not commensurate with New York’s tremendous cost of living, so I haven’t been able to amass the savings needed to weather this period.”

Senior entertainment writer Adam Vary wrote
[on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/adambvary.bsky.social/post/3m7bqums5qc2w)
on 6 December: “The great axe of modern journalism has come for me: Today was my last day at Variety.”

Variety associate news editor J. Kim Murphy also said he had been
[laid off.](https://x.com/jkimmurphy/status/1998197671811764614?s=20)

*11 December:*
UK-based sports publisher GRV Media cut around 60 content creation jobs between September and December, blaming falling Google referral traffic,
[Press Gazette reported.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/uk-based-sports-publisher-cuts-60-staff-due-to-google-updates/)

The changes took the company from about 156 people to 94, of whom 89 are working full-time.

GRV Media closed around 12 sites as they were “no longer financially viable”.

The publisher saw its monthly unique users fall by around 65% to 15 million since September

Co-founder Vic Daniels said of platforms like Google and Facebook: “At the end of the day, these are huge companies with the power to move markets and to movstve positions very quickly, and they do so changing their algorithms, and the impact that that has on the online publishing ecosystem is profound.”

## November 2025 journalism job cuts

### Metro – Unknown number

*21 November:*
DMGT-owned Metro told staff it would be making job cuts as a result of declining web traffic but did not sure the number of roles it was targeting.

It told staff it planned to focus resources “in areas with the highest potential for growth” and that it would be “mitigating” challenges on traffic with “licensing deals, social video growth and other revenue streams”.

[Read the full Press Gazette story here.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/metro-to-cut-staff-as-web-traffic-declines-and-focus-shifts-to-social-video-growth/)

Other planned cuts at DMG Media were reported around a similar time, including at the Daily Mail’s Femail according to Popbitch.

### The Dallas Morning News – 26 jobs

*19 November:*
Hearst has reportedly told staff it plans to eliminate the copy desk, including the sports copy desk, and outsource print page production at The Dallas Morning News, according to the paper’s union.

Hearst acquired the paper in September.

The change would lead to the newsroom losing 26 staff – a “direct violation” of the union’s collective bargaining agreement with the employer.

“We have kept an open mind about this merger,”
[the union shared on X](https://x.com/DallasNewsGuild/status/1990917966758846748/photo/1)
. “We had hope, and remain hopeful, that this can be a productive partnership that results in strong journalism for the state of Texas.

“But for that to happen, Hearst needs to respect our contract and come to the bargaining table in good faith.”

The union added it is “devastated” for colleagues, and it will “defend the contract through all legal channels available”.

### BBC – At least 85 jobs

*19 November*
: BBC has announced
[up to 85 staff are at risk of redundancy](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/bbc-puts-84-product-delivery-managers-at-risk-of-redundancy/)
as the corporation looks to lay off delivery managers from the product team in response to increased costs, competition, a changing digital landscape and changing audience behaviours.

Delivery managers are responsible for helping engineering teams with workload forecasting and delivery, and powering online services such as BBC iPlayer.

Press Gazette understands the cuts follow the BBC adopting a model set out by Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG), an organisation which provides product development consultancy services.

### Raconteur – At least 17 jobs

*18 November*
:
[Around 15 staff have been cut from a team of 32](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/digital-journalism/raconteur-team-halved-following-technology-advice-takeover/)
since US-based technology media publisher Technology Advice took over Raconteur in September 2024, Press Gazette understands.

The sales team was reportedly the worst affected, with finance staff, marketing and data teams also cut. A source also said the six-strong editorial team has been halved since the takeover, with one redundancy and two leavers not replaced. Some Raconteur staff are understood to have been absorbed into Technology Advice.

### Cosmopolitan – Eight jobs

*15 November:*
US-based Hearst laid off four staffers at Cosmopolitan in November.

[Hearst Union said](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRDVgNnAcSO/?hl=en)
this brought the total number of staff members “lost” in 2025 to eight “including four members of colour, one member who was let go the week they returned from maternity leave, and one member who was still on their maternity leave”.

*13 November:*
Utah news website KSL.com cut the roles of two sports journalists.

The site’s sports director Josh Furlong
[said on X](https://x.com/JFurKSL/status/1988682391226052644)
: “Today has been an extremely tough day, and I honestly don’t know the best way to put this all into words. I lost two phenomenal sports reporters, Ryan Miller and
[Caleb Turner](https://x.com/calebturner23/status/1988644161101430866)
, to company changes.”

### Crain – At least 25 jobs

*12 November*
: More than 25 jobs have been cut across business and B2B publications owned by Crain Communications in the US,
[according to Talking Biz News.](https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/crain-lays-off-more-than-25-across-publications/)

The layoffs reportedly included at least four editorial staffers at Automotive News, plus others at Crain’s Cleveland Business, Crain’s Chicago Business, Crain’s Detroit Business and Crain’s New York Business, Ad Age, Modern Healthcare and Pensions & Investments.

### Axios – 19 jobs

*6 November:*
Axios is cutting
[19 jobs in product, tech and design](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/magazines/newsweek-editor-jennifer-cunningham-redesign-magazine/)
, according to The Wrap.

Co-founder and chief executive Jim VandeHei told staff: “This is a difficult, but necessary, move to meet our evolving tech strategy.”

### Conde Nast – More than six jobs

*6 November:*
Six jobs are being lost as a result of Conde Nast folding Teen Vogue into Vogue.com with the intent of
[providing a more unified experience.](https://www.vogue.com/article/teen-vogue-is-joining-voguecom)
Vogue Business has also recently moved to the same website.

The News Guild of New York and Conde United union said they “strongly condemn Conde Nast’s consolidation plans for Teen Vogue, a move that is clearly designed to blunt the award-winning magazine’s insightful journalism at a time when it is needed the most.

“Management plans to lay off six of our members, most of whom are BIPOC women or trans, including Teen Vogue’s politics editor – continuing the trend of layoffs at Conde disproportionately impacting marginalised employees.”

[The statement](https://x.com/condeunion/status/1985488830019907664)
added that Teen Vogue now has no journalists explicitly covering politics.

The departures also include editor-in-chief Versha Sharma, with Vogue head of editorial content Chloe Malle set to oversee the brand.

Teen Vogue culture editor Kaitlyn McNab reportedly wrote on X that she was laid off
[“along with 70% of my incredible team”.](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/04/nx-s1-5598290/teen-vogue-layoffs)

[Conde Nast said](https://www.condenast.com/news/teen-vogue-is-joiningvoguecom)
of the changes: “The title will remain a distinct editorial property, with its own identity and mission; sitting under the Vogue umbrella will provide a more unified reader experience across titles.”

Other brands within Conde Nast also saw some roles laid off according to the Conde Union.

### PBS SoCal – 10 jobs

*6 November:*
Ten jobs, or 10% of staff, at Los Angeles public media operation PBS SoCal were cut in October,
[according to Current.](https://current.org/2025/11/pbs-socal-cuts-10-of-workforce/)

PBS SoCal has lost $4.3m in federal funding due to cuts by Congress. The organisation brought in revenue of about $49.2m in 2024.

A spokesperson for the organisation said: “While our community has stepped up in meaningful ways since the rescission, that generosity has not been enough to fully close the gap.”

They also said: “Over the past several months, we have carefully reviewed our operations and made strategic decisions to ensure the organisation’s long-term sustainability.

“We are deeply grateful to each of our colleagues for their contributions to our mission. PBS SoCal remains focused on building a sustainable public media organisation, strengthening our digital capabilities and continuing to serve as a leading contributor within the PBS system.”

### McClatchy – ‘Dozens’ of jobs

*6 November:*
Dozens of journalists were cut at US regional newspaper publisher McClatchy.

The changes included the
[closure of its real-time news operation](https://www.status.news/p/mcclatchy-layoffs-dc-bureau)
, affecting almost 24 people who produced breaking news for the national network.

McClatchy also
[closed its bureau in Washington DC](https://x.com/jeremymbarr/status/1985791484797325694)
, affecting multiple reporters who covered Congress and the White House.

## October 2025 journalism job cuts

### CBS News – Almost 100 jobs

*30 October:*
CBS News was hit by layoffs at Paramount, which affected about 10% of staff (or up to 2,000 people) at the parent company, after the $150m acquisition of The Free Press.

CEO David Ellison said: “When we launched the new Paramount in August, we made clear that building a strong, future-focused company would require signifcant change – including restructuring the organisation…

“In some areas, we are addressing redundancies that have emerged across the organisation. In others, we are phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth.”

Almost 100 jobs were cut at CBS News.
[Areas affected](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/cbs-saturday-morning-overhsil-paramount-layoffs-1236564636/)
included: the feature programme Saturday Morning, a unit dedicated to covering race and culture, the
[climate team](https://www.climatecoloredgoggles.com/p/cbs-news-gutted-climate)
(four jobs gone out of six), the closure of the Johannesburg bureau, and the end of streaming shows CBS Evening News Plus and CBS Mornings Plus.

### Vibe – Two jobs

*21 October:*
Two reporter roles were lost at R&B and hip-hop music magazine Vibe when it was bought by Rolling Stone.

However there were
[plans to recruit](https://pitchfork.com/news/rolling-stone-merges-with-vibe/)
a new head of the Vibe brand, a video and podcast host, and an events producer.

### NBC News – 150 jobs

*17 October:*
NBC News is cutting about 150 jobs, amounting to 7% of its newsroom and 2% of the wider NBCU News Group, following the spin-off from the network of MSNBC.

The NBC News verticals for several diverse communities, NBC BLK for issues affecting black communities, NBC Asian America, NBC Latino and NBC OUT covering LGBTQ+ stories, are losing their dedicated teams as a result although they will continue to put out stories.

[The Wrap cited a source](https://www.thewrap.com/nbc-news-layoffs-number-versant-split/)
saying the cuts overall did not target specific teams and were driven by budget considerations and the need to streamline editorial production.

NBC News currently has about 140 jobs open across the whole news group, which also includes local news stations and Spanish-language network Telemundo, and a dozen of the jobs being axed are being repurposed into new roles that those affected can apply for.

Cesar Conde, chairman of NBC Universal News Group, said in a
[memo to staff reported by Variety](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/nbc-news-layoffs-100-to-150-jobs-1236553614/)
: “Today is a hard day. We have had to make some difficult decisions, including the elimination of positions across NBC News. While these decisions are necessary to remain strong as an industry leader, they are not easy and are never taken lightly.

“We have sought to minimise the number of affected team members, and our teams’ decisions should not be seen as a reflection on our colleagues who will be leaving. We will miss them and their valuable contributions.”

### TTG – Three people

*22 October:*
Three people were made redundant as UK-based B2B travel trade title closed in print after 72 years.

They were two sub-editors and a part-time designer.

[Read more about the digital-only plans on Press Gazette here.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/b2b/travel-magazine-ttg-closes-print-title-to-focus-on-digital-and-events-growth/)

### Wall Street Journal – About 12 people

*17 October:*
The Wall Street Journal has made changes to the structure of its health, science and education teams which have reportedly resulted in
[about a dozen](https://x.com/katie_robertson/status/1978545607481446474)
reporters and editors being laid off.

Editor-in-chief Emma Tucker said in a note to staff,
[published by Talking Biz News](https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/wsj-restructures-health-science-and-education-makes-layoffs/)
, said: “The health group is returning to the business team after becoming a separate coverage area during the Covid-19 pandemic. Coverage of health insurers, pharmaceuticals and the business of health will become a bureau under Kate Linebaugh’s Corporate group.

“Our existing personal-health coverage, which already resides within the Corporate team, will be merged with the new Health bureau to create a single, cohesive reporting group. We will recruit a new health bureau chief to lead our coverage.

“The Science bureau will be merged into our Education team, which remains part of National Affairs. Erin White is the bureau chief, and she will ensure a cohesive vision for these intertwined areas.

“As a result of these changes, we are reducing the size of the teams affected and are saying goodbye to some colleagues.”

Tucker specifically said goodbye to health and science coverage chief Stefanie Ilgenfritz, who had been with the WSJ for more than 35 years.

### People Inc – 226 jobs

*9 October*
: The biggest consumer publisher in the US, People Inc, is laying off 226 people (or 6% of its staff). CEO Neil Vogler positioned the news as part of a pivot towards new ways of working rather than a cost-cutting move in a memo to staff.

The company, formerly known as Dotdash Meredith, has a large (declining)
[print business but growing digital revenue.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/media_business/dotdash-meredith-now-people-inc-says-premium-ads-up-as-programmatic-declines/)
Its brands include People and Better Homes and Gardens.

In a memo to staff,
[quoted by Axios](https://pressgazette.co.uk/media_business/dotdash-meredith-now-people-inc-says-premium-ads-up-as-programmatic-declines/)
, Vogel said: “Today’s actions are a difficult but necessary step as we continue to evolve our business and prioritize investments that will help us continue to thrive in today’s media environment. While days like these are tough, we are confident in People Inc.’s future and focused on our plans,” Vogel said in the staff memo, noting the cuts will impact various departments.

“This requires many new skills to take advantage of new opportunities. Over the last year, we’ve hired 320 people to help us drive growth in new areas and we currently have over 40 open roles that will infuse new expertise and capabilities across our brands and teams.”

“We are aggressively investing in new ways to connect directly with our users, and directly with our advertisers and partners, including a number of high profile projects that we have launched or are in the pipeline.”

### Lee Enterprises – At least seven jobs

*1 October:*
[At least five journalists are believed](https://www.richmonder.org/times-dispatch-opinion-editor-gone-after-latest-round-of-layoffs/)
to have been cut at the Lee Enterprises-owned Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia.

The roles affected included opinion editor, two patch reporters, a breaking news reporter and a sports reporter. The paper was reportedly left with ten staff reporters.

A reporter each at Lee-owned Mechanicsville-Ashland Local
[and The News Virginian](https://augustafreepress.com/news/media-staff-layoffs-impacting-operations-at-two-virginia-newspapers/)
were also reported to have been laid off. The latter title reportedly lost its last dedicated full-time reporter.

## September 2025 journalism job cuts

### KION-TV – At least 13 people

*26 September:*
More than a dozen people are
[said to have been laid off](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/california-kion-tv-news-division)
from California local news station KION-TV.

The broadcaster will
[“no longer produce its own full local newscasts”](https://kioncentralcoast.com/news/top-stories/2025/09/23/kpix-news-launches-on-kion-expanding-statewide-coverage-for-the-central-coast/)
but has partnered with KPIX CBS San Francisco to receive “the most significant stories” from Northern and Central California alongside its local reporting.

### PBS North Carolina – 32 people

*26 September:*
[PBS North Carolina has laid off 32 employees](https://current.org/2025/09/pbs-north-carolina-lays-off-32-employees/)

[according to the team’s director David Huppert.](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7376691583842152448/)

Jobs were affected across the content and production, marketing and creative, engineering, education, development and finance divisions, according to Current.

Chief executive David Crabtree said: “These difficult decisions, combined with non-personnel expense reductions that began in January 2025, were necessary to ensure PBS North Carolina’s long-term financial stability.

“With these changes now in place, we are in a stronger position to continue serving the people of North Carolina and fulfilling our public media mission for decades to come.”

Crabtree said the operation has been affected by the loss of $4.8m in annual federal funds, or 15% of its budget, as well as rising operational costs.

### STV – 60 jobs

STV said
[28 roles are affected across newsrooms](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/up-to-80-journalists-strike-in-scotland-over-stv-job-cuts/)

*6 September:*

in
[its international operation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ryanbrownejourno_opentowork-activity-7377321237544603648-JYMn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAWjZRUB1l0uv6wLS7XeUnXlb4Bbrn9rDZ8)
, which has headquarters in London and Singapore.

A CNBC spokesperson told Deadline: “We are currently consulting on proposed changes to the organisational structure of the international team to ensure we are best positioned to deliver on our long-term strategic priorities.”

### PBS – 34 people

*5 September:*
US public service broadcaster PBS is making 34 layoffs and cutting many open positions as it closes 100 roles overall in response to budget cuts of $8m.

It comes after significant cuts to federal public service broadcasting were made this year.

Before any layoffs were made, the organisation had already frozen hiring, restricted travel and paused pay rises,
[The New York Times reported.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/04/business/media/pbs-job-cuts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare)

Chief executive Paula Kerger said: “These decisions, while difficult, position PBS to weather the current challenges facing public media.”

## August 2025 journalism job cuts

*8 August:*
Vox Media has cut 15 jobs at food title Eater despite chief executive Jim Bankoff saying in an interview with Puck last week that he did not anticipate any upcoming layoffs.

[The Vox Media Union said:](https://www.instagram.com/p/DND2aSmsR2c/?hl=en)
“This is the second major round of layoffs at Eater this year, following a round earlier this year that decimated Eater’s award-winning cities network.

“To be abundantly clear: these layoffs are a gut-job, one that eliminates roughly a third of Eater’s union jobs. It is also a cowardly capitulation to the fallacious insistence that generative AI is the future of search and publishing.

“We are devastated that our colleagues have lost their jobs, and we are deeply worried about the future sustainability of Eater without them.

“Eater is currently in the midst of celebrating its 20th anniversary, and right now there is not much to celebrate.”

According to Puck’s Dylan Byers Vox Media has denied that the cuts were a cost-cutting exercise as

## July 2025 journalism job cuts

### Ziff Davis – 23 people

*31 July:*
Ziff Davis is laying off 23 people, or 15% of its unionised workforce,
[according to The Verge.](https://www.theverge.com/news/715220/ziff-davis-creators-guild-cnet-layoffs)

Most (19) of the layoffs are coming from tech news and reviews site CNET, affecting its finance, broadband and sleep coverage areas and its copy desk. CNET was acquired by Ziff Davis for $100m last year.

Some staff members at Lifehacker, Mashable and ZDNet are also being let go.

Anna Iovine, unit chair of the Ziff Davis Creators Guild, said: “It’s very clear to us that these cuts aren’t about journalism. They’re based on money and greed.”

### Digital Frontier – 16 people

*29 July:*
Technology newsbrand Digital Frontier has announced it will no longer be publishing content as it takes a “step back” to “reassess” its next steps. It launched about 18 months ago.

All 16 staff members have been made redundant, meaning directors Joshua Hewes and Gemma Thomson are the sole remaining employees of Digital Frontier.

### Chicago Tribune – Eight people

*28 July:*
The Alden Global Capital-owned Chicago Tribune laid off eight people, or about 10% of the newsroom, on Thursday 24 July
[according to the Chicago Sun-Times.](https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/07/24/chicago-tribune-newsroom-layoffs-alden-global-capital)

The newspaper reported that the layoffs included five members of the paper’s union and three others, who covered housing, food and the Chicago Bears football team.

The layoffs followed a buyout offer to the newsroom that was only taken by one employee who had reportedly already been planning to retire.

### Fortune – 10% of workforce (potentially around 36 people) + four separately from Europe team

*22 July:*
Business publication Fortune is cutting 10% of its global workforce, which
[reportedly stands at about 360 full-time staffers](https://www.thewrap.com/fortune-layoffs-ai-cuts/)
meaning almost 40 people could be affected.

In a staff memo published in full
[by Talking Biz News](https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/fortune-ceos-email-about-its-layoffs/)
, Fortune chief executive Anastasia Nyrkovskaya cited the impact of recent changes in platform and audience behaviours, such as the rise of video and Google’s AI Overviews hitting traffic referrals.

“The business landscape is changing rapidly, between the onset of AI, the resulting decline of website traffic trend, and the rise of audio and video as popular formats,” she wrote. “Sustainable media business models need to change along with it.

“As a 95-year-old organisation that has always prioritised high-quality, trusted business journalism and convening top executives, we are well suited to meet this moment. But it also requires we act quickly and decisively in redirecting our organisation to be more efficient, exiting some processes and businesses so that we are prepared to build new ones.”

Nyrkovskaya said Fortune’s strategy moving forward would be “to cultivate our premium franchise communities and deliver premium editorial content to them. We will be leaning into premium coverage of key Fortune 500 industries and into events that serve business leaders, such as our Most Powerful Women franchise…

“With these moves, we will be on strong financial footing to weather what’s ahead. We have incredible assets at our disposal: 71 years of ranking the Fortune 500, a significant number of loyal print, digital and newsletter subscribers, our best-in-class executive membership communities, and incredible talent in each of you.”

***Update:***
*The editorial team covering Europe for Fortune was separately made redundant before the cuts to 10% of the global workforce. The affected staff were: executive editor Alex Wood Morton, news editor Oliver Smith and Europe business reporters Ryan Hogg and Prarthana Prakash, all based in London.*

### Informa Techtarget – 10% of workforce

*18 July:*
US-headquarted technology publisher Informa Techtarget, created through the B2B giant’s acquisition of Techtarget in December 2024, has announced plans to carry out a net reduction of 10% of its global workforce by the end of this year.

It said it would carry out a “reorganisation plan designed to… put greater emphasis on areas of strength and opportunity, better position the company for growth, and enable us to make the most of our increased scale, breadth, and diversity following the 2024 business combination.

“The plan involves streamlining certain areas and functions and reinvesting in others to improve the delivery of products and services to customers and enhance the company’s global go-to-market capabilities.”

[Techtarget said the reorganisation would cost](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0002018064/000095017025096085/ttgt-20250714.htm)
between $19.5m and $45m, of which around $9.5m would relate to staff severance, and that it is ultimately expected to create about $20m in annual savings.

Informa Techtarget president Rebecca Kitchens, who held the same role at Techtarget before the acquisition, is leaving the company on 31 July as part of the plan.

### Reach – ‘Around 50’ people

*10 July:*

. Some staff moved to the new owners and the rest were laid off.

*9 July:*
Bloomberg Media is cutting around a dozen jobs out of its newsroom of about 2,700 people in a restructure towards three areas in which it has “leapt forward” in recent years.

In a memo to staff,
[published in full by Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-made-rare-staff-cut-newsroom-overhaul-staff-memo-2025-7)
, Bloomberg editor-in-chief John Micklethwait said the changes will “consolidate our achievements in each of these three areas – and set ourselves up for future expansion”.

The main changes are: deepening coverage of private markets and credit, which will now combine with the legal, wealth and investing teams under one editor, combining the teams focusing on front-page and breaking news, and unifying the editorial video teams and the photography teams.

Micklethwait said: “To those who worry that this is driven by cost cutting, I will point out that we will end this year with a bigger newsroom than we started it. We have a responsibility not only to deliver the best content we can to our customers but also to create that content as efficiently as possible.”

### Laptop Mag (Future) – ‘Fewer than’ ten people

*2 July:*
Future told staff on 1 July that it was shutting down the 34-year-old consumer technology brand Laptop Mag with immediate effect.

[The Verge reported](https://www.theverge.com/news/695969/laptop-mag-shutdown-future-plc)
that staff were told: “After careful consideration and a review of our long-term strategy, we’ve made the decision to close the Laptop Mag business effective today.”

[Adweek reported](https://www.adweek.com/media/laptop-mag-shutdown-future-portfolio/)
that fewer than ten people were affected.

Future has owned Laptop Mag since 2018 via its acquisition of US-based Purch (formerly Tech Media Network) which also owned Tom’s Guide and Tech Radar. Laptop Mag has been digital-only since 2013.

## June 2025 journalism job cuts

### Portland Tribune – Around six people

*22 June:*
At least six journalists have reportedly been laid of at the Portland Tribune, which has been owned by Carpenter Media since last year.

[Oregon Live](https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2025/06/fresh-layoffs-leave-portland-tribunes-newsroom-nearly-empty.html)
reported that the cuts included the managing editor, a veteran reporter, the life section editor, a sports journalist and at least two others.

John Carr, publisher of Carpenter’s titles in Oregon and North Carolina, said: “All changes were a necessary result of a long trend of these particular editions being financially unsustainable.”

Oregon Live noted it was initially unclear whether the paper would continue but that Carr had said “the website will remain active” and remains committed to community news, an area “that is both important to residents, and not consistently covered by most other outlets”.

The Portland Tribune was also among titles affected by
[cuts implemented by Carpenter Media in 2024.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2024/)

***Update 25 June:***

## May 2025 journalism job cuts

### Sky Sports News – Seven people

*28 May 2025:*
Seven Sky Sports News presenters and journalists have reportedly
[left in a round of voluntary redundancies.](https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/35146057/sky-sports-departure-seven-presenters-melissa-reddy-rob-wotton/)

Those affected include presenters Rob Wotton, Teddy Draper and Jasper Taylor, reporters Jeremy Langdon, Melissa Reddy and Fadumo Olow, and a news editor.

The broadcaster told The Sun the changes were not primarily aimed at cost cutting but “making us more agile and better equipped to serve audiences”.

Mark Alford, director of Sky Sports News, said: “We would like to thank each of our colleagues for their huge contribution to Sky Sports News over the years. We wish them all the best for their future endeavours.”

### Business Insider – 21% of staff (around 150 posts)

*28 May:*
Business Insider is cutting 21% of staff amid “ongoing volatility in traffic and distribution”.

The total
[include 23 staff based in the London bureau](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lindsay-dodgson-14274774_i-and-22-of-my-wildly-talented-colleagues-activity-7334140059425673216-JLQX/)
who have been told their jobs are at risk. Senior reporter and union leader Lindsay Dodgson wrote: “The list is full of award winners, scoop machines, long-timers, and reporters with deep expertise and wide ranging contact books — the heart of the company.”

In a note to staff
[published in full by Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/media/business-insider-layoffs-traffic-sensitivity/)
, chief executive Barbara Peng said Business Insider needs to reduce its “reliance on traffic-sensitive businesses”.

“We’re at the start of a major shift in how people find and consume information, which is driving ongoing volatility in traffic and distribution for all publishers. The impact on our industry has been profound, with many publications shuttering in recent years.

“Our business is diversified, which has helped insulate us. We’ve also significantly improved how we monetize traffic — each visit to our site now generates twice as much revenue as it did just two years ago.

“Still, 70% of our business has some degree of traffic sensitivity. We must be structured to endure extreme traffic drops outside of our control, so we’re reducing our overall company to a size where we can absorb that volatility.

“We’re also exiting the majority of our Commerce business, given its reliance on search, and maintaining a few high performing verticals.”

Peng also said Business Insider is focusing on areas “where we can deliver unique, lasting value and serve our audience in ways only Business Insider can” with hires being made to cover those, and “scaling back on categories that once performed well on other platforms but no longer drive meaningful readership or aren’t areas where we can lead”.

In addition it is launching live events and planning to launch

### The Washington Post – Unknown

*27 May:*
The Washington Post is offering voluntary buyouts to staff who have been there for more than ten years as well as the video desk, copy editing desks and opinion team.

A
[message to staff from executive editor Matt Murray](https://x.com/BenMullin/status/1927379741197115867/photo/1)
, first reported by Ben Mullin at The New York Times, said: “The program is part of our ongoing newsroom transformation efforts aimed at reshaping and modernizing the newsroom for the current environment. Like the rest of our industry, we are adapting to changing habits and new technologies that are transforming news experiences. Even as we have begun creating new departments and welcoming new colleagues, to reach new audiences we must increase our staffing flexibility and expand in areas such as audience data and social video.”

Murray said that the video team is being restructured and refocused “to place much greater emphasis on developing repeatable franchises and more personality-driven formats for Youtube, other social media channels and off-platform more broadly, while embedding some video producers and facilitators in the core newsroom to help all our journalists and artists produce more video for our products.”

Meanwhile the main copy desk and the sports copy desk will be combined to work online, alongside a new print team.

### South London Press – Around six jobs

### ITV – 220 people

*20 May:*
ITV is planning to make more than 220 redundancies across Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women – about half of the employees who produce output for those shows.

It said it would reinvest in other more streaming-friendly genres like drama and sport but the changes affect news, current affairs and other daytime scheduling.

In addition Good Morning Britain, which will extend by 30 minutes, will move from being produced by ITV Studios to being made by a dedicated team within ITV News at ITN with the ai
[m of reducing duplication](https://deadline.com/2025/05/itv-daytime-overhaul-job-cuts-1236405614/)
between what is being produced by the two services.

[ITV said:](https://www.itv.com/presscentre/media-releases/itv-announces-changes-scheduling-and-production-its-daytime-shows)
“This change will see ITV bring all its national news gathering into one hub, with Good Morning Britain benefitting from the journalistic and production resources already in place for national news bulletins, for the website and for digital platforms including ITVX…

“The expanded Good Morning Britain will continue its mix of news, interviews, debate and competitions while allowing for the inclusion of more regional news, more agenda-setting investigations and exclusives and more reporting on and analysis of the biggest stories of the day around the UK and the world.”

Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women would start to be produced by one team sharing resources within ITV Studios under the plans.

Kevin Lygo, managing director of ITV’s media and entertainment division, said: “Daytime is a really important part of what we do, and these scheduling and production changes will enable us to continue to deliver a schedule providing viewers with the news, debate and discussion they love from the presenters they know and trust as well generating savings which will allow us to reinvest across the programme budget in other genres.

“These changes also allow us to consolidate our news operations and expand our national, international and regional news output and to build upon our proud history of trusted journalism at a time when our viewers need accurate, unbiased news coverage more than ever.”

### GBH – 10 people

*9 May:*
Boston public TV and radio broadcaster GBH is laying off about ten people from its World channel as it stops producing original programming.

[It blamed Corporation for Public Broadcasting cuts](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/09/business/gbh-layoffs/)
separate to President Trump’s move away from federal funding to public media.

### Time Out – At least four people

*6 May:*
Time Out reportedly laid off journalists at Time Out in Chicago (
[its editor and a regular freelance journalist](https://chicago.eater.com/2025/5/5/24424319/substack-chicago-dining-critics-maggie-hennessy-dennis-lee-party-cut-time-out-layoffs)

### LAist – 8 people

*6 May:*
Non-profit Los Angeles digital and radio newsroom LAist has
[laid off eight employees, a 5% reduction in staff](https://laist.com/news/laist-cuts-staff-by-5-percent)
. It said it has cut 61 positions through buyouts and layoffs since 2023.

LAist said it has a projected budget shortfall of $4-5m “because of declines in advertising, digital monetisation issues and overall cost increases”.

It will also be affected by President Donald Trump’s order to end federal funding for public media, with $1.7m or about 4% of its $40m budget coming from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting but said this would be truly felt from 2026 with the start of a new two-year funding cycle.

LAist president and chief executive Alejandra Santamaria told staff the organisation has dipped into its reserves but they “have been depleted to ensure continued operations.

“Given the additional risk of losing another $1.7m annually from our CPB grant, it is unfortunately time to make difficult changes.”

### Los Angeles Times – 14 people

*2 May:*
Los Angeles Times staff have suffered
[a third round of layoffs in as many years, according to the newsroom guild.](https://latguild.com/news/2025/5/2/guild-statement-on-more-layoffs-at-the-la-times)

The Los Angeles Times Guild said 14 people had been laid off, equating to a cut of 6% of newsroom staff.

It said ranks had halved in three years – 40 people accepted buyouts earlier this year – and blamed “a stubborn reliance on ever-declining print revenue; a leadership team without a business plan; and a subscriber exodus triggered in part by the handling of The Times’ presidential endorsement”.

### Polygon – ‘More than 20’ people

*1 May:*
More than 20 layoffs reportedly accompanied Vox Media’s
[sale of video game news site Polygon to Screenrant and Gamerant owner Valnet.](https://kotaku.com/polygon-sold-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-digital-gaming-1851778655)

Executive editor Chelsea Stark said: “I’m still in shock and so so deeply angry about Vox Media’s decision to sell Polygon. I am one of the over 20 people laid off today from the best damn website out there. I’m so proud of the place we built, and the workplace I helped shape.” The departures also included editor-in-chief Chris Plante.

The news came at the same time as

Local businessmen JW Roth and Kevin O’Neil saved the title after a previous closure at the start of 2024 but have now said: “Ultimately, the alignment between the leadership and the editorial direction of the papers no longer reflected the voices they sought to represent.”

The brand, along with sister title the Colorado Springs Business Journal, have been bought by Colorado Media Group owner Dirk R Hobbs
[who has assumed responsibility for the ongoing operations.](https://gazette.com/business/colorado-springs-independent-and-business-journal-again-change-hands/article_0dd5339d-542f-48e3-a4f1-4af704fd4fc3.html)

Scarbrough said Marketplace is bringing together its radio and digital newsrooms, moving offices to share with sister American Public Media-owned station LAist, putting more into its social channels, website, newsletters, podcasts and video and focusing more on content pillars “financial literacy, sustainability, entrepreneurship, the new workplace and this economy”.

*22 April:*
The UK’s biggest news agency PA Media has put 74 members of its UK content team at risk of redundancy with the aim of cutting up to 25 jobs.

The cuts would amount to about 8% of the UK editorial team.

A spokesperson said: “The news media industry is changing and PA Media is proposing to adapt its editorial operation to meet customer needs.

“It is always regrettable putting roles at risk and we are working with stakeholders to minimise the impact on our people as far as possible.”

resulting in 43 job losses.

[published by Semafor journalist Max Tani](https://x.com/maxwelltani/status/1905366508316098894/photo/1)
, staff were told: “These roles eliminations didn’t affect a single team or part of the organisation; they touched different brands and departments beyond our own.”

The email continued: “It’s important to note that this isn’t an overall reduction in force; rather, it is a moment for us to ensure we are putting our resources where they will have the greatest impact. We are actively hiring to continue to harness the power of our brands and recruiting for roles best positioned to grow our footprint. We remain optimistic and excited about what we’re doing together as an organisation.”

“To that end, tech coverage will be part of a wider technology and media group, based in New York.”

The title is advertising for two deputy technology bureau chiefs, based in New York and San Francisco respectively, as well as three other roles.

“In the coming weeks, we’ll be reconfiguring beats on the tech team to give more of them a wide ambit,” Tucker said.

### MSNBC – 99 people

*25 February:*
[MSNBC is planning “mass layoffs” of 99 people](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/msnbc-layoffs-employees-wga-east-1236320323/)
who are part of the Writers Guild of America East, the union has said, with at least nine shows affected.

“This devastating news comes after the slow, painful trickle of announcements regarding a near-total overhaul of the network’s broadcast line-up,” WGA East said.

The changes include the departure of 7pm anchor Joy Reid, which fellow presenter Rachel Maddow
[described as “a bad mistake”.](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/rachel-maddow-sounds-off-msnbc-line-up-joy-reid-1236319547/)

Affected staff reportedly work on: The ReidOut, Alex Wagner Tonight, The Weekend, Andrea Mitchell Reports, Ayman Mohyeldin Reports, Weekends With Jonathan Capehart, The Katie Phang Show, Jose Diaz-Balart Reports and Inside With Jen Psaki.

The union also said: “Although the company has acknowledged that there are plenty of job openings at MSNBC, it has cruelly insisted that the workers slated for layoff must reapply for their jobs to remain employed.

“The MSNBC Union demands the company not lay off any of the employees it has slated to be laid off but rather reassign them as needed. In the event that any employees are not retained, we demand the company follow the layoff provisions of the collective bargaining agreement that it entered into with the union.”

### New York Public Radio – 21 roles

*25 February:*
New York Public Radio, which owns brands including the WNYC news station and Gothamist local news website, is reportedly cutting about 7% of staff or 21 full-time roles due to its financial shortfall.

Chief executive LaFontaine Oliver said in a memo, seen by The New York Times, that three of the full-time roles will become part-time. A further seven open roles will be cut.

Oliver said: “These actions are necessary: They bring the organization into a financially sustainable position precisely so that this work can continue.”

He added: “These staffing reductions have taken place against the backdrop of a dynamic media and political environment that has demanded of us much change and adaptability. I know it hasn’t been easy, and I wish things were different.”

In September New York Public Radio

focused on its TV operations but add the same number of digital roles like data scientists and product engineers, with the first 100 joining in the first half of the year according to The New York Times.

An internal memo from CNN chief executive Mark Thompson, reported on by
[CNN’s Reliable Sources newsletter](https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1737637976815046abcd5e04d/raw?utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+%E2%80%93+Jan.+23+2025&utm_medium=email&bt_ee=%2BzFeptQWc0Yrhy9tI8Fm8sxvxLfVb%2Fg%2FryIXtPQ1gkClOQvWAIat%2FxB6sMXC91os&bt_ts=1737637976817)
, said the cuts amount to about 6% of the current workforce.

“Our objective is a simple one: to shift CNN’s gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN’s future as one of the world’s greatest news organisations,” Thompson said.

But because of the planned new hires, he added: “We don’t expect total headcount to fall much this year, if at all. That’s because of the $70m we’re investing in our digital plans and the many new jobs it will pay for.”

CNN is also planning a paid-for streaming version of CNN, a lifestyle product, and a “further major pivot to digital video”.

### Chicago Sun-Times – 35 people

*22 January:*

by non-profit Chicago Public Media in 2022.

The offer is being made to editorial staff at the Sun-Times and non-journalists at WBEZ but specific roles are not being targeted. The newsrooms of the two brands are already being merged. The Sun-Times has 104 journalists while WBEZ has 64. The total number of employees at Chicago Public Media is 278.

WBEZ said the move could save between $3m and $5m in annual expenses with the potential departure of 20 to 30 people.

Chicago Public Media chief executive Melissa Bell said in a message to donors: “Our hope is that this action and other efforts will reduce our costs so that we can avoid more significant cost-cutting measures down the road.

“This is a proactive decision that allows us to align our organization’s size with our goals while strengthening our most valuable and impactful initiatives and ensuring our financial sustainability.

“While we’ve made strides in adapting to the rapidly changing media landscape, these efforts haven’t yet translated into the sustainable revenue we need.”

**Update 19 March:**
[The Chicago Sun-Times has now reported that 35 Chicago Public Media employees](https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/03/18/chicago-sun-times-lose-20-staff-buyout-offer)

It said those leaving are mainly writers and editors and that there are fears they will leave gaps resulting in “recognisable changes to its content”.

The total breakdown is: 30 leaving from the Chicago Sun-Times, 23 from the newsroom. It currently has an editorial staff of around 107. A further five people are leaving WBEZ.

The departures will save $4.2m annually and no further layoffs are planned.

Those growth areas reportedly include entertainment, food and ad tech arm D/Cipher.

“We also announced the appointment of Brad Reagan as an enterprise editor in London. Brad is a deeply skilled big-story editor who has been behind some of our most ambitious and successful work. This will increase our capacity to turn-around high-ambition enterprise work faster and more flexibly in the region. Brad will report to Bruce Orwall in New York.

“This new structure means that we are proposing to close a small number of beats that have a narrower focus, or where we have adequate global coverage in other bureaus. As a result, there will be some redundancies. Those whose jobs will be affected were notified yesterday.”

We unfortunately have to do this to right-size our business so Huffpost can survive this challenging time.

“No part of the newsroom is immune from this. Even me… This decision was difficult, yet obvious for me. Huffpost leadership made no decision to cut staff lightly, and in hopes of saving some roles, I knew I would face eliminating my own. I could not, in good faith, ask others to make this difficult decision without doing the same.”

She added that the company needs to decide “what next steps to take with the editor-in-chief role”.
