Internews’ Earth Journalism Network is seeking to hire an Africa Coordinator to support a new 3-year project which will leverage the power of media and civil society to contribute towards more sustainable and fair forest governance in Asia and Africa. The project, which is funded through the FCDO Forest Governance Markets and Climate (FGMC2) programme, will support journalists, media and civil society in Liberia, Cameroon, Ghana, Vietnam and Indonesia to enhance media coverage of forest governance issues, raise public awareness and influence decision makers to support more equitable and sustainable forest management.

The Africa Coordinator, who will be hired at 50% Level of Effort, will provide region-specific media knowledge, particularly for Liberia, Cameroon and Ghana, organize virtual and in-person trainings, and provide strategic planning and operational support for all Africa activities. They will also facilitate coordination and synergies with other Internews projects in Africa. The Africa Coordinator will report to the FGMI Project Director and will work closely with the Earth Journalism Network (EJN) Programme team and relevant regional teams at Internews.
