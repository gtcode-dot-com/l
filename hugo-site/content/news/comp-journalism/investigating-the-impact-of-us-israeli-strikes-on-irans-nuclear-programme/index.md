In the early hours of June 13, Israeli missiles slammed into apartment buildings across the Iranian capital, Tehran.

By morning, it became apparent that nine men
[Israel said were closely associated](https://x.com/IDFFarsi/status/1933825956109545978)
with the country’s nuclear programme were dead.

Videos posted to social media showed buildings in flames and rescue workers sifting through rubble as they looked for survivors.

Dozens of civilians who lived in the same apartment blocks as those targeted also died in the strikes. In one instance, a 14-storey residential tower completely collapsed.

But this was just the start, the opening shots of what Israel dubbed Operation Rising Lion – a 12-day operation targeting Iranian scientists, nuclear sites, security figures and military capabilities.

While Iran sought to fight back, launching missiles and drones at Israel, the damage and death toll inflicted by Israel was far greater.

On day 10 of the operation, the United States joined with Israel, carrying out strikes on nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan.

Bellingcat worked with FRONTLINE (PBS),
*The Washington Post*
and Evident Media to piece together the events of the 12-day war to try and understand the true impact of the strikes on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran maintains the programme is peaceful but Israel has long
[suspected](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/idf-press-releases-israel-at-war/june-25-pr/information-on-the-iranian-nuclear-project/)
that it is designed to develop nuclear weapons.

FRONTLINE filmmakers were given access to Iran, where they visited the sites of some of the strikes and spoke to neighbours and relatives of those who were killed as well as high-ranking Iranian officials.

*The Washington Post*
also spoke to senior intelligence and military sources involved in Operation Rising Lion, and the filmmakers visited Vienna to speak with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the organisation that has been responsible for monitoring Iran’s nuclear programme.

Bellingcat, alongside
*The Washington Post*
, analysed open source information such as satellite imagery, social media footage, local media coverage, death notices and cemetery records to understand how the attacks on Iranian scientists unfolded as well as analyse the civilian cost of the conflict.
