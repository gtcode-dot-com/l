National newspaper editors from across the political spectrum have come together to call for the next King’s Speech to include provisions against intimidating legal tactics, known as SLAPPs.

SLAPPs, or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, are lawsuits targeting journalists, news organisations, whistleblowers or other groups publishing information in the public interest that are widely regarded as meritless, abusive and aimed at bullying them into silence.

Some 127 media and legal figures have now signed an open letter to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy and Justice Secretary David Lammy urging “universal anti-SLAPP provisions” to be included in the next King’s Speech to be held in May.

The letter noted that in the five years since the UK Anti-SLAPP Coalition was founded, “SLAPPs have been documented against journalists, tax transparency experts, online reviewers, patients, environmental campaigners, local residents, sexual violence survivors, whistleblowers, academics, tenants, victims groups and advocates, and social media users, to name a few.

“In these cases, wealthy and powerful claimants have misused the British justice system and the costs associated with participating in pre-trial and court proceedings to stifle protected speech and public participation. This is a society-wide issue that requires a society-wide remedy.”

The signatories include the editors of The Guardian (Katharine Viner), Telegraph (Chris Evans), Sunday Telegraph (Allister Heath), The i Paper (Oliver Duff), The Independent (Geordie Greig), Financial Times (Roula Khalaf), Bloomberg (John Micklethwait), Reuters (Alessandra Galloni), The Economist (Zanny Minton Beddoes), Prospect (Philip Collins) and The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (Franz Wild).

Other senior media figures to have signed the letter include Times Media chairman John Witherow, Reach chief content officer David Higgerson, former Guardian and Prospect editor Alan Rusbridger and Index on Censorship chief executive Jemimah Steinfeld.

Journalists who have directly faced libel lawsuits themselves who signed the letter include The Nerve co-founder and former Observer writer
[Carole Cadwalladr](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/carole-cadwalladr-arron-banks-libel/)
,
[Catherine Belton](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/putins-people-journalist-and-publisher-settle-roman-abramovich-libel-claim/)
, the Washington Post Russia reporter and former FT journalist who wrote the book Putin’s People, Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, and Guardian investigative reporter
[Tom Burgis](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/judge-dismisses-libel-claim-against-tom-burgis-kleptopia/)
who wrote the book Kleptopia: How Dirty Money is Conquering the World.

Mill Media founder and editor Joshi Herrmann said: “It’s far too easy for bad actors to abuse the law in the UK in order to bully media companies and suppress public interest journalism. Mill Media has been threatened by wealthy and powerful people several times in the past few years, and we often receive legal threats that are clearly designed to stop us publishing accurate and important stories.

“The Government needs to keep its promises and pass strong anti-SLAPP rules fast to protect the free press, one of this country’s most valuable legacies.”

The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act (ECCTA), which came into effect in 2023, contains mechanisms to strike out abusive claims early and protect defendants from punitive costs but only when in relation to publication about economic crime.

The letter said ECCTA was “a welcome and official recognition of the problem, [but] the provisions are both limited in scope and flawed in approach”.

Lammy said last month that the Government
[planned further action on SLAPPs](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/dec/08/uk-will-ramp-up-clampdown-on-abusive-slapps-lawsuits-lammy-says)
: “We’ll protect the people who shine a light on corruption in the first place, the journalists and activists who shield the public’s right to know.

“By stopping the powerful from using abusive lawsuits – so-called ‘SLAPPs’ – to intimidate reporters, silence investigations, and bury the truth under a mountain of legal threats. Because sunlight is always the best disinfectant.”

The letter said in response: “We agree. Now is the time to turn rhetoric into action. By bringing forward universal anti-SLAPP measures in the next King’s Speech, Parliament will finally be given the opportunity to establish robust, accessible and universal protections against abusive legal

threats and actions.”

The letter continued: “It is the Government’s duty to protect us from this system being weaponised against free expression and everyone’s ability to participate fully in society. However, without an effective early dismissal mechanism, an objective test for filtering SLAPPs out of court, and the ability to minimise costs and penalise bad conduct, courts and judges do not have the tools or guidance they need.

“At a time of unprecedented pressure on our judicial system, court resources should not be wasted on SLAPPs, which are by definition an abuse of the court process.”
