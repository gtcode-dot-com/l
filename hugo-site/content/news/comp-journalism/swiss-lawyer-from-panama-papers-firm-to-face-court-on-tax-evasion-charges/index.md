A Swiss lawyer and former executive of Mossack Fonseca, the embattled Panamanian law firm at the center of ICIJ’s
[Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/)

investigation, will face court in Germany next year, according to news outlets

, Tamedia and
[Der Standard](https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000298330/ex-mitinhaber-der-panama-papers-kanzlei-steht-in-deutschland-vor-gericht?ref=seite1_entdecken)

.

Christoph Zollinger, 56, will stand

trial

in March 2026 in the regional court of Cologne for allegedly “forming criminal organizations and aiding and abetting tax evasion in two cases,” a court statement obtained by the media outlets said.

Prosecutors allege a tax loss of about 13 million euros, or roughly $15 million

, linked to 50 offshore companies.

Through his lawyer, Zollinger declined to comment on the ongoing case.

Zollinger was one of the three most senior employees at
[Mossack Fonseca](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/20160403-mossack-fonseca-offshore-secrets/)

for years. In 2016, ICIJ, Süddeutsche Zeitung and more than 100 news outlets revealed how the firm helped politicians, celebrities, fraudsters and others set up shell companies in secrecy jurisdictions, based on a leak of 11.5 million confidential files.

# **Controversial decisions**

Zollinger joined Mossack Fonseca in 1997 and later became partner, according to media
[reports](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/germany-seeks-arrest-of-senior-panama-papers-lawyer/)

. The attorney, a former member of Panama’s bobsled team, became a citizen of the Central American country, married a Panamanian woman and was appointed “special ambassador,” Süddeutsche Zeitung and others
[reported](https://www.tdg.ch/un-suisse-troisieme-homme-de-mossack-fonseca-921960761406)

.

Although Zollinger left the firm years before the Panama Papers investigation, leaked records showed he was involved in some of Mossack Fonseca’s most controversial decisions, including its work for sanctioned

.

In 2011, as Syria’s civil war began, Zollinger
[defended](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/20160404-banks-lawyers-hide-assets/)

the firm’s business with Makhlouf, a cousin of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, despite a freezing order by the United States Treasury Department accusing Makhlouf of corruption. He later told German reporters the comments he made internally were “an error.”

In 2020,
[German investigators issued an international arrest warrant](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/germany-seeks-arrest-of-senior-panama-papers-lawyer/)

for him, Der Standard
[reported](https://www.derstandard.at/story/3000000298330/ex-mitinhaber-der-panama-papers-kanzlei-steht-in-deutschland-vor-gericht?ref=seite1_entdecken)

. At the time, Zollinger was living in Switzerland, where he was renovating old farmhouses and writing a thriller under the pseudonym “Christoph Martin.” The arrest warrant against Zollinger was suspended in 2024, the report said.

According to the court,

German authorities allege that Zollinger was “a member of a group of companies, along with other individuals who are being prosecuted separately, which, in return for payment, arranged for private individuals worldwide to set up so-called ‘offshore companies’ based in Panama or other countries known as ‘tax havens.’ ”

If convicted, he faces up to seven and a half years in prison.
