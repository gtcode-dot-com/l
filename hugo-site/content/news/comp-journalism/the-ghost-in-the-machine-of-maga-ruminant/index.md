His Curmudgeonship Jonah Goldberg is holding court to pontificate about the troubles in the land, and he isn’t wanting for material. Jonah covers his recent takes on Richard Nixon and the pardon power, as well as the Epstein files, tariffs, impeachment, and what awaits in 2028.

Plus: Jonah’s Star Trek-laced takes on infinite energy, instant food generation, and the elimination of work.
