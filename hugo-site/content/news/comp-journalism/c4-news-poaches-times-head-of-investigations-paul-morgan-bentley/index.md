He will work with Channel 4 News investigations editor Cathy Newman, who was just

Channel 4 News editor Esme Wren said: “Paul is one of the UK’s leading investigative journalists… He has a standout record of agenda-setting reporting and a clear commitment to holding power to account and exposing wrongdoing.

“He joins us at a time when public service investigative journalism matters more than ever, and I know he will play a central role in strengthening our investigations for years to come.”

Morgan-Bentley won Scoop of the Year at the
[British Journalism Awards 2023](https://pressgazette.co.uk/press-gazette-events/british-journalism-awards-winners-2023/)
and the Online Video category at the
[Future of Media Awards 2023](https://pressgazette.co.uk/press-gazette-events/future-of-media-awards-winners-2023/)
for his undercover investigation into British Gas force-fitting pre-payment energy meters into the homes of the vulnerable.

He was also part of the Times team that was highly commended at the British Journalism Awards 2024 in collaboration with Channel 4 Dispatches for their investigation into allegations of sexual abuse against Russell Brand.

He said: “I have been a huge fan of Channel 4’s distinctive agenda-setting journalism for many years and of the way it engages and inspires young and new audiences.

“This is a special opportunity at a time when high quality trusted news is more important than ever and I’m excited for the challenge.”
