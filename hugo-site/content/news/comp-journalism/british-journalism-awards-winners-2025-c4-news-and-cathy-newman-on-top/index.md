Channel 4 News was the News Provider of the Year winner for the second year running at the
[British Journalism Awards](https://awards-bja.pressgazette.co.uk/)
2025, supported by headline sponsor Starling Bank.

Channel 4 News presenter
[Cathy Newman](https://pressgazette.co.uk/subject/cathy-newman/)
was named Journalist of the Year for her landmark coverage on an abuse scandal in the Church of England including an exclusive interview with Justin Welby that led to the first ever forced resignation by an Archbishop.

[Channel 4 News](https://pressgazette.co.uk/subject/channel-4-news/)
was also recognised for its reporting from inside Gaza, including via a 50-minute special by Palestinian filmmaker Yousef Hammash, and from Syria, led by Paraic O’Brien who was one of the first Western TV journalists to report from inside the country after the regime collapsed.

The Scoop of the Year award was, unusually, shared between The News Agents and the Daily Mail as both helped to lead on the reveal of a huge data breach affecting thousands of Afghans who became eligible for resettlement in the UK as a result. Judges paid tribute to the consortium of publishers who fought against the UK government to reveal the story which also included The Times, Independent, FT, Press Association and Telegraph.

The winners of the 14th annual British Journalism Awards were revealed at a gala dinner held at London’s Hilton Bankside on Thursday night, hosted by BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine.

They were chosen by 70 independent British Journalism Awards judges who whittled down more than 600 entries from national newspapers, TV, radio, podcasts, regional newsbrands, specialist websites and newsletter-based start-ups.
[See the full 2025 shortlist here.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/press-gazette-events/british-journalism-awards-shortlist-2025/)

To be eligible the work must have been produced primarily for a UK audience and published between 1 September 2024 and 31 August 2025.

The winning work must have brought important new information to light, had an impact, demonstrated skill and rigour, and both served the public interest and was interesting to the public.

The awards were supported by headline sponsor Starling Bank, as well as Amazon, AOP, Find Out Now, the Journalists’ Charity, Journalist.net, Orsted and People’s Postcode Lottery.

Channel 4 News and Channel 4 combined won the most awards overall (six) also including Foreign Affairs Journalism for the Basement Films documentary Gaza: Doctors Under Attack which was left in limbo by the BBC for several months before finding its new home.

[The Guardian](https://pressgazette.co.uk/subject/guardian-news-and-media/)
won five awards, including two for its former Gaza correspondent Malak A Tantesh who was named New Journalist of the Year and won the Marie Colvin Award for outstanding up-and-coming journalists of the calibre of the Sunday Times correspondent who was killed in Syria in 2012.

The Guardian was also recognised twice for its collaborative work: with Hope not Hate on embryo IQ screening in the Health & Life Sciences Journalism category, and with +972 Magazine in the Technology Journalism category for reporting on Microsoft ‘s ties with the Israeli military during the war in Gaza.

The Times and Sunday Times saw the next most wins, with four across the titles including jointly with Channel 4 Dispatches and the Mirror in Business, Finance and Economics Journalism for revealing the full details of the property estates owned by King Charles and Prince William.

The titles also won in the Comment Journalism, Sports Journalism and Campaign of the Year categories – the latter for work revealing a dip in vaccination rates.

For the first time two newsletter-based start-ups were recognised: Democracy For Sale won the Specialist Journalism prize for work on the funding of UK politics, while The Mill in Manchester took home the Local Journalism prize for pieces exposing “chaos” inside the University of Greater Manchester.

Press Gazette editor-in-chief and chairman of the judges Dominic Ponsford introduced the awards by saying: “These are the most important awards in the world because they celebrate the people defending reality itself.

“In a world where politicians lie brazenly, and where the media is being overwhelmed by AI-created slop, we gather here tonight to try and strengthen the most important pillar of our western civilisation – journalism.”
