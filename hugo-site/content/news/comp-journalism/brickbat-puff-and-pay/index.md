The Scottsdale, Arizona, city council has updated its
[smoking restrictions](https://www.azfamily.com/2025/10/28/scottsdale-expands-smoking-ban-include-vaping-after-teens-advocacy/)
to include e-cigarettes and vape pens, banning their use in enclosed public spots (such as malls, theaters, bars, and restaurants), in city-owned areas (such as bus stops, playgrounds, pools, and stadiums), and anywhere within 50 feet of public schools. Violators could face fines of up to $300.
