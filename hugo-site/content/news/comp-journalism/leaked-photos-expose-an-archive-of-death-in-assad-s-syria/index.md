A
man lies on a metal surface — emaciated, dead. He is photographed at multiple angles: up close, his chipped, yellow teeth glowing; from the side, his cloudy eyes like frosted glass; from afar, his genitals in full view. He is labeled No. 3659.

Another man, No. 4038, is strewn in the back of a van, his naked, shriveled body speckled in blood. Flies feed on him.

The activist Mazen al-Hamada, No. 1174, lies in his prison uniform atop a marble floor, the imprint of restraints on his wrists. His bare feet are bruised.

No. 2389 is a newborn baby.

Other pictures show corpses stacked like firewood, stick-thin arms and legs askew, ribs, collarbones and shoulders jutting out from a heap of bones. Mouths agape and eyes ajar, their tortured bodies ready for disposal.

These skeletal remains are the grotesque results of former Syrian president Bashar Assad’s killing machine. There is a sinister, suffocating silence in these and more than 33,000 other excruciatingly high-quality photographs of people, nearly all men, who were arrested and killed by the Assad regime primarily between 2015 and 2024.

Captured by Syrian military photographers, the images are part of the
[Damascus Dossier](https://www.icij.org/investigations/damascus-dossier)
, an investigation based on a cache of more than 134,000 records obtained by
[German broadcaster NDR](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/syrien-assad-verbrechen-damascus-dossier-102.html)
and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and 24 media partners. The Damascus Dossier sheds new light on the inner workings of the former Syrian government’s security and intelligence agencies. The leaked photographs are the largest single collection of images of murdered Syrian prisoners ever obtained by a news outlet. More than 10,200 individual prisoners were photographed, with up to 177 photos taken in a single day.

The photos were sent to military courts, where a judge would sign off on the deaths, essentially granting members of the Assad regime judicial immunity for their crimes, according to a former military officer. The officer served as the head of the Evidence Preservation Unit of the military police in Damascus between 2020 and 2024. He provided the images to a source who then shared them with NDR. “There are things people need to know,” he said in an interview with NDR. “There are people whose families need to know where they are and what happened to them.”

Until now the Syrian public did not know about the existence of these photos.

Assad, now reportedly living under asylum in Russia, reigned over Syria during the country’s 13-year bloody civil war, which was prompted by a wave of anti-government protests. Under his rule, authorities endeavored to extinguish all signs of dissent within the country, abducting people they deemed political opponents and, in many thousands of cases, killing them in prison. The Syrian Network for Human Rights, a nongovernmental organization that tracks Syrian war casualties, estimates that the Assad regime disappeared more than 160,000 people, although the actual number could be far higher.

Bashar Assad’s fall from power in December 2024 marked the end of a violent 13-year civil war in Syria that left hundreds of thousands of civilians and soldiers dead and millions of citizens displaced.



The Assad dynasty began in the 1970s, when Bashar’s father, Hafez al-Assad, seized power. Hafez turned Syria into a single-party militarized state, and ruled by stoking sectarian differences between the country’s ethnic and religious groups. Upon his death in 2000, the then-34-year-old Bashar became president and began implementing economic policies that benefited his political allies and deepened national divisions.

Assad’s rule came to a head in 2011 during the Arab Spring, when the Syrian revolution erupted. The government responded to mass protests with indiscriminate violence, gunning down protesters and carrying out extrajudicial arrests and killings.

As the situation escalated, Western nations expanded sanctions against Assad and his government.

Facing a convergence of threats— from Syrian rebel troops to Al-Qaeda operatives and Islamic State forces, along with growing global condemnation —, Assad turned to increasingly brutal tactics. Over the next 10 years, his regime deployed chemical weapons and attacked civilian areas in an attempt to force rebels to surrender.

Then, in December 2024, rebel group Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham toppled the Syrian government in a surprise rapid offensive and assumed power. Assad fled to Moscow, where he reportedly remains in exile.

In life, the detainees were brutalized. In death, they were treated with further contempt and robbed of the right of a proper burial.

When the regime fell in December 2024, families could finally search through prisons and hospital morgues for their loved ones. They scavenged for handwriting on cell walls or clothing in mass graves in the hope of finding anything that suggested their fates. But many thousands of Syrians found nothing, and whatever hope they had turned to agony as they confronted the idea that they might never learn what the government had done to their family members. The Damascus Dossier finally tells the story of what happened to those people.

The files and the wrenching information they carry can never offer total peace to the families whose loved ones were killed. Yet the mere existence of these images ensures that, whatever impact these people might have made in life, in death they are immortalized.

The Damascus Dossier photographs are a harrowing sequel to a cache of images depicting prisoners killed between 2011 and 2013, which were smuggled out of Syria more than a decade ago by a military defector codenamed Caesar. The Caesar photos set off a series of international prosecutions and sanctions against the Syrian government, serving as evidence in the
[first-ever torture trial against the Assad regime](https://syriaaccountability.org/inside-the-raslan-trial-a-forensic-analysis-of-the-caesar-photos/)
, in Germany, in 2020. That case resulted in the life imprisonment of Anwar Raslan, a former Syrian colonel, who was linked to at least 4,000 cases of state-led torture, and the 4½-year prison sentence of Eyad al-Gharib, a former officer, for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity.

The photos also inspired a U.S. law known as the
[Caesar Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/31)
, which levied sanctions against Assad and the Syrian government and authorized the State Department to collect evidence on and prosecute perpetrators of war crimes in Syria.

In 2014, Caesar, who earlier this year
[revealed himself as Farid al-Madhan](https://www.ictj.org/latest-news/syria%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98caesar%E2%80%99-whistleblower-unveils-identity)
, the former head of the forensic evidence department with the military police in Damascus, offered background on the photos to a team of international prosecutors. He told them that military officers were tasked with photographing bodies to prove that orders of murder had been carried out. The photos were also used to produce death certificates, without the families having to see their loved ones’ bodies, he said. In most cases, those government-issued death certificates falsely listed the inmates’ causes of death as “cardiac arrest” or “cardiorespiratory arrest.”

Despite all the evidence, Assad’s government denied the validity of the Caesar photos.

The new trove of images shows the severity and magnitude at which Syrian authorities continued the killings for 11 more years, as well as the macabre process of photographing and categorizing the prisoners’ bodies.

A team of reporters from ICIJ, NDR and
[Süddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/)
conducted an in-depth analysis of a sample of hundreds of the photographs. The analysis showed that the majority of victims bore signs of starvation and physical harm. Many of them were naked. The Damascus Dossier images show that as each prisoner died, he was transported, photographed and catalogued. In almost all cases his detainee number was written on a white card placed on his body, written in marker on his arm, leg, torso or forehead, or superimposed on the photo. A military photographer, wearing rubber boots or surgical covers on his feet, snapped photos of the body from multiple angles and then filed the images in meticulously organized digital folders.

The images are carefully titled to include information on the inmate’s number, the first name of the photographer, the date the photo was taken and, in many cases, the security branch that arrested the prisoner, including Military Police, the Air Force Intelligence Directorate and the General Intelligence Directorate.

Based on evidence from additional records in the Damascus Dossier and on reporter visits to Syria, the photos were likely taken in military hospitals to which the detainees were transferred.

Though Assad officials mostly reduced the detainees to numbers, some of them are named in the photos. ICIJ and NDR were able to extract roughly 320 names. They include: Adel, Hassan, Malik, Walid, Hussein, Youssef, Saad, Fadi, Yassin, Fatima.

And on and on.

“Freedom,” said a family member of the activist Mazen al-Hamada, who was among the killed prisoners, was made possible “by the sacrifices of Mazen and the other martyrs who gave their lives so cheaply for our sake.”

“There’s a feeling of pain at his loss. But the general feeling is one of pride: pride in Mazen and the sacrifices he made for the homeland.”

What the new Syrian government or international authorities do next — whether they use the images as evidence against the perpetrators of the regime or share them with families who are tormented by not knowing what happened to their loved ones — holds the possibility for resolution to tens of thousands of deaths. It’s also a chance to restore, after all these years, the dignity of the deceased.
