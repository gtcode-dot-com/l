The Cato Institute has posted a
[non-paywalled version](https://www.cato.org/commentary/foot-voting-housing-affordability#)
of my recent
[*Washington Examiner*
article](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/3902519/foot-voting-housing-affordability/)
on "Foot Voting, Housing, and Affordability." I don't see a paywall blocking the article on the
*Examiner*
website. But some readers have told me they have encountered one. Regardless, you can now avoid any paywall by reading it at the Cato site. Here is an excerpt that summarizes the article:

The rest of the article develops these points in detail, explaining the benefits of curbing exclusionary zoning, and also why rent control, deportations, and tariffs all actually exacerbate the housing crisis instead of alleviating it.

I cover some of these issues in greater detail in my recent
*Texas Law Review*
article, "
[The Constitutional Case Against Exclusionary Zoning](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4728312)
" (coauthored with Josh Braver). We also published a
[shorter, nonacademic version](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/constitutional-case-against-exclusionary-zoning/678659/)
in the
*Atlantic*
