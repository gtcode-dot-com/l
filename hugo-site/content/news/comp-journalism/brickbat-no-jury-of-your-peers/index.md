British Justice Secretary David Lammy has proposed
[ending jury trials](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7vdvrnnvzo)
for most criminal cases, reserving them only for rape, murder, manslaughter, or other "public interest" offenses. Cases that currently go before juries would instead be handled by a new judge-only "bench division." The ministry cites a backlog of over 78,000 cases, and Lammy says judge-only trials would reduce delays for victims and defendants. But many lawyers warn the change would erode a foundational safeguard of the justice system and say the backlog stems from chronic underfunding of the judicial system rather than jury trials.
