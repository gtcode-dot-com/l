#### Organization

The Examination

#### Location

Remote

#### Deadline

January 15, 2026

The Examination is seeking an editor with deep experience managing impactful stories and projects to lead our food and polluting industries reporting teams. This is a role for someone who can inspire and guide original reporting that uncovers harmful corporate practices, misleading marketing campaigns, regulatory failures and other forces that undermine public health.

In this pivotal position, you will shape cross-border stories that hold corporate and governmental actors accountable for health harms worldwide. From the earliest stages of an idea, you will work closely with reporters to develop sharp, feasible pitches with strong potential for triggering meaningful change at the local and global levels. You will shepherd stories and projects through rigorous research, sourcing and reporting, editing written stories and other audience-facing assets, all the way to publication.

You will oversee the careful gathering and verification of evidence – whether from human sources, documents, public records, or data analysis – ensuring each investigation lands with clarity, accuracy, and urgency. You will also steer collaborations with partner newsrooms around the globe, extending The Examination’s reach and influence, and mentor reporters to sharpen their investigative skills and grow as journalists.

Part of your work will involve monitoring the global health and industry landscape to identify under-reported threats on the food and pollution beats, pursuing leads that others overlook, crafting follow-up stories and explainers that build on our investigations, and representing The Examination at conferences and public events.

The ideal candidate will bring expertise in managing complex editorial collaborations across multiple outlets – an approach at the core of The Examination’s model – and will be energized by finding innovative ways to engage both broad audiences and the communities most at risk from the harms we uncover in the making and delivery of our journalism. Experience leading corporate accountability projects or global health investigations is strongly desired.
