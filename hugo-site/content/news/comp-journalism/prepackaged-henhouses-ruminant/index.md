After deftly disposing of some punditry on the government shutdown and the Epstein files, Jonah Goldberg jumps head first into the topics of the week: postliberalism, groypers, and the immense challenges of political labels. Plus, dedicated listeners will be treated to a rant on Tucker Carlson and Japan.
