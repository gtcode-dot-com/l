West Yorkshire police
[arrested](https://metro.co.uk/2025/12/03/man-arrested-in-the-uk-for-posing-with-gun-in-the-us-plans-to-sue-the-police-25097070/)
Jon Richelieu-Booth at his home after someone complained about a LinkedIn photo he posted of himself legally holding a gun while on vacation in Florida. He spent the night in a cell. Police initially cited allegations of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, as well as stalking. Those charges were quickly dropped, but then he was accused of a public order offense related to a different social media post, though police never specified which one. After months of legal trouble, the Crown Prosecution Service dropped that charge too.
