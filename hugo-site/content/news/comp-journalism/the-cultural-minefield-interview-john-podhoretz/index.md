Today on
**The Remnant**
Jonah Goldberg indulges two of his favorite hobbies: competing in TV nerdery with John Podhoretz (grand poohbah of
*Commentary*
) and bashing the Straussians. John and Jonah cover the Claremont Institute, the decline of TV and cinema,
*Death by Lightning*
, and Mary Shelley’s
*Frankenstein*
.

[Jonah Goldberg](https://thedispatch.com/author/jonah-goldberg)

Jonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C. Prior to that, enormous lizards roamed the Earth. More immediately prior to that, Jonah spent two decades at National Review, where he was a senior editor, among other things. He is also a bestselling author, longtime columnist for the Los Angeles Times, commentator for CNN, and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. When he is not writing the G-File or hosting The Remnant podcast, he finds real joy in family time, attending to his dogs and cat, and blaming Steve Hayes for various things.
