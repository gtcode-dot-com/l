The
*Washington Post*
[reported](https://wapo.st/49KbUJ1)
yesterday that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth did not merely order the initial strike on a boat off of believed to be transporting drugs, but gave the specific order to kill those on the boat. After the first strike hit the boat, a second strike was ordered to take out two survivors "clinging to the smoldering wreck" caused by the first.

Jack Goldsmith posted on this report yesterday at Executive Function. His essay,
["A Dishonorable Strike,"](https://www.execfunctions.org/p/a-dishonorable-strike)
begins:

I don't think this argument comes close to working without deferential reliance on a bad faith finding by the president about the non-international armed conflict and much greater stretches of precedent than the United States previously indulged after 9/11.

Whether Hegseth was aware of this second strike, or his initial order was properly interpreted to direct it is unclear, but it does not change the bottom line. Goldsmith writes:

> In short, if the Post's facts are correct, it appears that Special Operations Forces committed murder when the "two men were blown apart in the water," as the Post put it.

The post concludes:

And surely the warrior ethos, whatever else it means, doesn't require killing helpless men clinging to the burning wreckage of a blown-up boat. The DOD Manual is clear because the law here is clear: "Persons who have been incapacitated by . . . shipwreck are in a helpless state, and it would be dishonorable and inhumane to make them the object of attack."
