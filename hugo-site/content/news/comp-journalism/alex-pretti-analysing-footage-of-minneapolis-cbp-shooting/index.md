On January 24, Alex Pretti,
[a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse](https://www.startribune.com/alex-pretti-identified-as-man-fatally-shot-by-federal-officers-in-minneapolis/601570109)
at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Health Care System, was shot and killed by federal agents on Nicollet Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shooting comes just over two weeks after Renee Good
[was shot and killed](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2026/01/13/analysing-footage-of-minneapolis-ice-shooting/)
by a federal agent in the same city

The United States Department of Homeland Security
[claimed](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2015115351797780500)
Pretti was killed after an “armed struggle” with DHS officers and that it seemed he had wanted to “do maximum damage”. Yet video footage shared online, showing shortly before and during the incident, appears to contradict that claim.

Some of the earliest available footage of the encounter was posted to Instagram and
[shows](https://www.instagram.com/p/DT5lGwIDsZJ/)
an agent crossing the street to talk to Pretti who appears to be filming with his phone, which he is holding in his right hand. According to DHS, agents were conducting an immigration arrest in the area.

The agent can be seen placing his hand on Pretti’s torso to push him back and away from the middle of the road towards the sidewalk.

Another video
[shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qlvdx6/new_video_of_124_ice_shooting_shows_victim_had/)
shows what happened after this initial contact, as well as the lead-up to the shooting. Pretti appears to put himself between two women after they were both shoved by a DHS agent. He is holding a cellphone, held sideways in his right hand.

*A video shows Pretti recording federal agents roughly a minute before he is shot. Pretti’s right hand is holding a cellphone, filming. Source:*

An agent can then be seen spraying Pretti with a substance from a canister, and continuing to spray him as he turns his back to him. At least five additional federal agents approach and attempt to force Pretti to the ground while one appears to strike him with a spray can.

Twenty-five seconds after Pretti is first sprayed, a shot is heard followed by nine more shots in the span of about six seconds. Additional

from the scene shows Pretti lying motionless on the ground.

## Video Analysis

Bellingcat further analysed the Reddit video, a separate
[video](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1207062461029220)
posted to Facebook and others taken at the scene to break down the key moments of the shooting, splicing them together (see Bluesky post below) to view in more granular detail.

Closer inspection of the videos shows that an agent appears to remove a weapon from the melee before the first shots are fired.

In both the Reddit and Facebook video, a federal agent wearing a grey jacket can be seen approaching federal agents who are on top of and struggling with Pretti. Notably, the agent’s hands are empty as he approaches. He can be seen reaching into and rummaging amid the bodies. About twelve seconds later, he is seen carrying a handgun away from the scene.

VIDEO

[Another video](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qm2vi0/heres_your_proof_with_the_moment_of_truth_isolated/?)
, also posted to Reddit, shows the agent removing a gun from a holster in Pretti’s waistband before he is shot.

Several aspects of the gun the federal agent is seen moving away with appear to match the gun DHS claim belonged to Pretti (and which they
[posted to X](https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2015115351797780500)
), a Sig Sauer P320, chambered in 9mm. Some posts online mistakenly claimed the photo of the gun was old
[due to a misunderstanding of Google Reverse Image Search](https://bsky.app/profile/eliothiggins.bsky.social/post/3md6u65e7cc23)
.

While some law enforcement agencies issue
[Sig Sauer P320 guns](https://www.sigsauer.com/blog/united-states-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-extends-sig-sauer-p320-contract-another-two-years-)
to their agents, the gun that DHS claims Pretti had is customized, and visually distinct from those that are standard issue.

These distinct features include a white pistol grip, black pistol frame, brown slide, and a red dot sight mounted atop the slide. The red dot sight and these various colours are visible on the gun the federal agent is seen leaving with.

Before the agent who takes the gun leaves the scene, it appears someone shouts “gun”, as can be heard in this
[video](https://x.com/i/status/2015257888063709345)
that was posted to
[X](https://x.com/i/status/2015257888063709345)
, and another video posted to
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qlutqb/alternative_angle_of_the_ice_shooting/?)
.

This Reddit video also shows that almost immediately after the agent in the grey jacket leaves with the gun, a single gunshot can be heard, followed by nine other shots.


Slowing it down, the
[same video](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qm2vi0/heres_your_proof_with_the_moment_of_truth_isolated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1)
shows that as the federal agent in the grey jacket removes Pretti’s gun, an agent in a black beanie, who appears to have a line of sight on the gun being removed, begins to draw his own weapon. As soon as the agent in the grey jacket moves away with the gun and leaves, the agent in the black beanie steps to where the agent in the grey jacket had been with his finger on the trigger and fires the first shot.

Two agents appear to fire their weapons from the footage available, one wearing a black beanie and another wearing a brown beanie, as can be seen in this
[video](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1207062461029220)
.

At the same time as the first shot is fired, the agent in the grey jacket is leaving with the gun taken from Pretti’s holster. An
[alternate angle](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qlvdx6/new_video_of_124_ice_shooting_shows_victim_had/)
appears shows that the slide of this firearm does not move to the rear. This would indicate that it was not fired. Multiple agents, including the agent in the grey jacket, look towards the man in the black beanie immediately after the first shot. Despite some online speculation, there is as yet no evidence that Pretti’s gun was fired.


Bellingcat synced and slowed three videos to show where the agent in the black beanie, and grey jacket, with both drawn guns are when the first shot occurs. What
[some commenters have suggested is impact marks](https://x.com/Landeur/status/2015216291607392269?s=20)
appear to be snow, that is visible before any shots occur.

Whatsmore, the agent with the black beanie’s right arm that was seen holding the gun moves backwards as the first shot is heard, likely due to the recoil from firing.

After firing once, the agent in the black beanie repositions, and then quickly fires three more shots at Pretti’s back at close range while he appears to try to stand up.

In this
[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1qlvdx6/new_video_of_124_ice_shooting_shows_victim_had/)
, multiple agents are piled on top of Pretti while his hands can be seen in front of him, on the ground. His hands remain in front of him as the agent in the grey jacket recovers the gun and moves away.

Pretti collapses onto the ground after the first shots and the agents back away. A second agent (the one wearing the brown beanie hat) then draws his gun and fires at least one shot. This is the fifth shot that is heard. The agent in the black beanie can be seen and heard firing more shots. Shots five through ten all fired at Pretti’s motionless body.

A
[video taken shortly after the shooting](https://x.com/Mollyploofkins/status/2015157087983042983)
shows two agents searching Pretti’s body with one appearing to be heard asking: “Where’s the gun?”.

Bellingcat contacted the Department of Homeland Security to ask why Pretti was shot and killed and whether he was in possession of his gun when the first shots were fired.

DHS did not respond by time of publication.

[DHS and CBP statements](https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/border-patrol-commander-greg-bovino-holds-news-conference-on-ice-operations-in-minnesota/672231)
have so far only stated that one agent fired shots, identifying them as an eight year veteran of Customs and Border Patrol who fired “defensive shots”. It is not known which of the two agents who appeared to fire shots in the videos analysed by Bellingcat is an eight year veteran of CBP.

Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino,
[on CNN the day after the shooting](https://x.com/Acyn/status/2015429550184989079?s=20)
, when shown video of the gun being removed before the shooting and asked why border patrol agents shot an unarmed man said, “You don’t know he was unarmed. I don’t know he was unarmed.”
[Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche](https://x.com/atrupar/status/2015440398710178014?s=20)
, when asked if Pretti was unarmed, said on Meet the Press, “I do not know and nobody else knows either, which is why we’re doing an investigation”.

In the
[same CNN interview](https://x.com/atrupar/status/2015429693059580346?s=20)
, Bovino also said that “The victims are the Border Patrol agents.” and that “The suspect [Pretti] put himself in that situation.”

[Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/man-shot-and-killed-by-federal-officers-in-minnesota-was-an-icu-nurse-his-parents-say)
said that Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry and did not have a criminal record.
