In England, the Hertfordshire Constabulary will pay Maxie Allen and Rosalind Levine around $26,000 after
[wrongly arresting](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/police-force-admits-it-wrongly-arrested-couple-who-complained-about-school/ar-AA1Qy8kf)
them for complaining about their daughter's school in a private WhatsApp group. Six police officers arrested the couple at their home and detained them for 11 hours on suspicion of harassment and malicious communications. Their "offense" was questioning the school's head teacher recruitment process. The school reported the parents to the police, claiming their messages upset staff. After a five-week investigation, police found insufficient evidence and took no further action.
