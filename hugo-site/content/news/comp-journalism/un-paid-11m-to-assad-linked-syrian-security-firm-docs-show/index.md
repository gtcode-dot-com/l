H
idden within a drab Damascus shopping center, at the end of an unlit fourth-floor hallway, is the unmarked office of Shorouk for Protection, Guarding and Security Services. A sign informs visitors that the hallway is monitored by cameras.

This is no ordinary security company. During Syria’s civil war, the United Nations paid Shorouk at least $11 million to provide security services to protect U.N. offices, from its de facto headquarters at the Four Seasons Hotel in Damascus to regional hubs.

Now, internal Shorouk documents reveal that the company was secretly owned by the intelligence services of former President Bashar Assad’s regime. Even as the United Nations poured money into the firm, those intelligence services were engaged in a violent campaign to crush any opposition to Assad.

In other leaked memos, the Syrian regime’s intelligence officers strategized on how to ensure Shorouk maintained its U.N. contracts. Syrian Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad wrote that this effort was important because the personnel for Shorouk and other security firms were monitoring U.N. employees for Assad.

Human Rights Watch and another NGO, the Syrian Legal Development Programme, warned the United Nations in 2022 about Shorouk’s multiple reported links to the Assad regime.  The United Nations responded that the contracts did not violate U.N. standards and continued to hire Shorouk for two more years.

The memos from Mekdad and Assad’s intelligence officers come from a trove of more than 134,000 records obtained by
[German broadcaster NDR](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/ndr-wdr/syrien-assad-verbrechen-damascus-dossier-102.html)
and reviewed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. These files form the basis for the
[Damascus Dossier](https://www.icij.org/investigations/damascus-dossier)
, a new investigation by ICIJ and 25 media partners in 20 countries. The project exposes the Assad regime’s vast apparatus for the detention, torture and murder of Syrian citizens. The investigation also offers an unprecedented look into how the Assad regime profited from U.N. contracts — and later pressured the organization to keep the money flowing after Shorouk’s ties to the regime were exposed.

Shorouk’s general manager, Wael al-Haou, said in an email to ICIJ that the information showing Shorouk’s ownership by the intelligence services was  “incorrect and inaccurate.” He added that Shorouk had never been owned by any state institution, and said in a subsequent interview that it was owned by himself and two other individuals. He did not provide their names.

But in internal Shorouk documents, obtained by ICIJ separately from the Damascus Dossier files, al-Haou sent a check to Assad’s intelligence services for what he said was its profit share in the company, and in another memo described Shorouk as “owned and controlled” by the intelligence services.

The U.N. contracts with Shorouk, which operated under several names, were signed in the midst of Syria’s bloody civil war. What began as a peaceful uprising in 2011 had by then devolved into armed conflict between the Assad regime and its opponents that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Syrians and drew in military forces from the United States, Russia and Iran. The Assad regime used brutal tactics to maintain its grip on power — including indiscriminate bombing, torture and chemical weapons attacks — before finally falling on Dec. 8, 2024.

The United Nations’ presence in Syria is made up of 12 non-resident and 17 resident entities, most of which deliver humanitarian and development assistance, the U.N. country team in Syria told ICIJ. U.N. agencies employ nearly 2,000 staff in Syria and received roughly $651 million in funding for humanitarian operations there in 2024.

U.N. agencies signed more than 130 contracts and purchase orders with Shorouk from 2014 through 2024. The U.N. Development Program paid Shorouk a total of $9 million during this time, and the security company also worked as a contractor for other U.N. agencies, such as the World Health Organization and World Food Program.

The United Nations continues to employ Shorouk as a contractor, the U.N. country team told ICIJ.

The United Nations’ contracts with Shorouk “meant that aid money was going directly into the pocket of a regime to fund a security apparatus that detained and killed tens of thousands of Syrians and a war machine that bombed and gassed their citizenry for over a decade,” said Emma Beals, a non-resident fellow at the Middle East Institute.

# ‘Owned and controlled’

Leaked Shorouk memos describe the company as an arm of the General Intelligence Directorate, one of the most ruthless enforcers of Assad’s rule. While many of the U.N.’s contractors in Syria were tied to regime insiders, the documents describe the first known instance of U.N. agencies hiring a company owned by Assad’s intelligence apparatus.

These internal Shorouk files come from a larger collection of roughly three dozen documents. They were provided by a source who gained access to them in the chaotic early days following the fall of Assad’s regime. ICIJ spoke with the source about how the documents were procured, checked that the information in the documents was internally consistent, and confirmed key details about Shorouk and specific Syrian intelligence branches in the files with publicly available information.

In one June 2019 document, the company sent a check for 50 million Syrian pounds, or roughly $100,000, to the intelligence agency, along with a letter from Wael al-Haou explaining that the funds were from the directorate’s “profit share in Shorouk.”

In a leaked 2021 letter, al-Haou sought help from the director of the intelligence agency to obtain weapons permits, writing that Shorouk should receive special treatment because it was  “the only company owned and controlled by the General Intelligence Directorate.”

Al-Haou, in a follow-up interview after his response to ICIJ, said he paid the GID protection money but denied that the directorate owned the company.

Shorouk’s website describes itself as “the leading security company in Syria,” boasting over 2,000 employees. Publicly available U.N. procurement data shows that it was the only major security contractor for the U.N. Development Programme in Syria from 2015 to 2024; in its response to ICIJ, the U.N. country team said that these contracts were not only for its own premises, but also to secure offices shared by multiple U.N. agencies in Damascus. One request for proposals from UNDP during this time sought to hire security guards to “conduct inspections of all persons, property or vehicles” entering U.N. facilities.

At the same time that U.N. agencies’ contracts with Shorouk allegedly helped to fund the General Intelligence Directorate, the United Nations’ own reports documented war crimes committed by the directorate.

A 2023 U.N. report stated that the directorate’s officers tortured Syrian civilians, including by repeatedly administering electric shocks to them. Another U.N. report, released in 2015, documents how officers from the General Intelligence Directorate raped and sexually tortured prisoners. A directorate officer, Anwar Raslan, was convicted by a German court in 2022 of crimes against humanity, including being an accomplice to murder, torture and sexual violence.

The United Nations has long come under fire from human rights groups for striking a devil’s bargain with the Assad regime. During the civil war, Syrian authorities redirected U.N. humanitarian assistance away from opposition areas that needed it most and ensured that valuable U.N. contracts were funneled to regime loyalists. Meanwhile, according to The Guardian, U.N. agencies hired dozens of friends and political associates of Assad and senior officials in his government. This included members of Foreign Minister Mekdad’s own family: The U.N. refugee agency hired his brother to serve as its interlocutor with the Syrian Foreign Ministry, and the World Health Organization employed his wife as a consultant.

In a response to ICIJ, the U.N. country team wrote that the United Nations had fully complied with all its procurement processes when hiring Shorouk, and that it had conducted “enhanced due diligence” on the company at the time. It said that it had not identified any “official documents or verifiable evidence” during its procurement process indicating Shorouk’s ownership by Assad’s intelligence services.

But the U.N. country team also noted that operating in Syria was “highly complex” under Assad, and that U.N. agencies had “extremely limited market options” to procure many critical services. During the 2022 bidding process for U.N. security contracts, the U.N. country team wrote, the Assad regime revoked the license of several other security firms. That left U.N. agencies with only two options to provide security in line with U.N. standards: Shorouk, and another reportedly regime-linked company called ProGuard. Both companies were classified as “high-risk” suppliers.

U.N. agencies “had no viable alternative and therefore proceeded to engage Shorouk despite the elevated risk profile,” the country team wrote to ICIJ. “Shorouk provided better value for money.”

After the Assad regime’s fall in December 2024, Shorouk did not disappear — it simply rebranded. Within weeks of the power transfer, it redesigned its logo to feature the new Syrian flag and posted advertisements for security guard positions.

Al-Haou, who said he has owned the company since 2014, claimed that Syria’s new government audited Shorouk’s operations and granted permission for the company to continue operations.  “[W]e are continuing our operations legally, with official approval from the current relevant authorities,” he told ICIJ.

Memos from the General Intelligence Directorate, which were obtained separately from the internal Shorouk documents, also show the company’s connection to Assad’s intelligence services. In July 2021, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Shorouk seeking the company’s comment for a forthcoming report, which it said would describe the company’s links to the Syrian military.

The Damascus Dossier includes a memo from a Syrian intelligence officer to the head of the GID arguing that failure to respond to the letter would give HRW a justification to pass along its information about Shorouk to the United Nations. The memo then proposes that a response should be prepared by Shorouk that provides evidence of the company’s legal status as a private enterprise. HRW said it never received a response.

The GID intervened in Shorouk’s business in August 2022, when a committee of senior Syrian intelligence officers sounded the alarm after learning that the office of the head of the U.N. country team in Syria was “re-evaluating” the United Nations’ contracts with Shorouk. The officers wrote in a memo that this re-evaluation represented a clear threat to national security.

In response, the intelligence services sought to pressure the United Nations to maintain its relationship with the country’s private security firms. Assad’s intelligence officials ultimately got what they wanted: U.N. contracts awarded to Shorouk in 2023 and 2024, the final two years of the regime, were worth more than in any previous years.

The senior intelligence officers recommended emphasizing to U.N. officials that they had no choice but to rely on Syrian companies. The regime could block the use of foreign security companies by either denying their employees visas or, if a foreign company sought to hire Syrian employees, mandating their approval by the regime “for security reasons.” The committee’s implication seemed to be that such approval would not be forthcoming.

The U.N. country team told ICIJ it had no “documentation or communication” regarding this re-evaluation, and was “not aware” of Syrian state officials contacting U.N. officials during this period to ensure Shorouk or other firms continued to receive U.N. contracts.

Assad’s intelligence services also concealed the companies’ ties to the regime. The committee of officers recommended lying to the United Nations by saying that these firms were private enterprises with “no connection or affiliation with any authorities,” and that the Syrian government did not interfere in their activities. In the same memo, however, it noted that the Interior Ministry had ordered all private security firms to take “comprehensive security precautions” to conceal the identities of their employees, “especially security personnel working for these companies.”

In a separate memo, Faisal Mekdad, then Syria’s foreign minister and subsequently vice president, laid out why the regime was determined to preserve these contracts. The companies, he wrote, “serve as a safeguard against any suspicious activities” by U.N. employees. That monitoring, he argued, was necessary because “it is no secret that some [U.N. officials] may be among those providing intelligence services to hostile agencies.” Allowing the United Nations to hire non-Syrian security contractors, he explained, would mean they could operate “out of sight of the relevant authorities.”

The U.N. country team told ICIJ that “we have not identified any incident” indicating Shorouk or other firms conducted monitoring of U.N. officials. Al-Haou wrote to ICIJ that Shorouk had no knowledge of the memos by the GID or Mekdad, and that the company’s guards “have certainly not and will not spy on UN officials.”

Mekdad also wrote that the Syrian state was pocketing some of the funds sent by the United Nations to pay the salaries of the firms’ workers. Syria was going through an economic crisis, and the state maintained an official exchange rate that valued the currency far higher than the black market rate. The United Nations paid the private security firms by transferring U.S. dollars to Syria’s Central Bank, which then converted the funds into Syrian pounds at the official rate — allowing the state to pocket the difference between the two rates. “This means that the state treasury benefits from the transfer of these salaries,” Mekdad wrote.

The United Nations’ re-evaluation of its contracts with Shorouk coincided with a wave of public criticism from Syrian and international experts about the hiring of contractors implicated in egregious human rights abuses. U.N. officials responded to these complaints by vigorously defending the U.N. contracts with Shorouk, and their broader operations in Syria. In a June 2022 email obtained by ICIJ, a senior official with the U.N. country team, Francesco Galtieri, responded to one critical report, titled “Rescuing Aid in Syria,” by warning the leadership of a prominent Washington, D.C.-based think tank that such reports “may lead to reputational damages not only for the UN but also for the authors of these pieces and the organisations they represent.”

The United Nations excludes contractors whose owners have been sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, but it is not obligated to adhere to sanctions by any member state — a policy that spared Assad, his family members and senior regime officials, who were shielded by Russia and China at the Security Council.

In practice, regime insiders routinely registered companies under civilians’ names to avoid scrutiny. The Damascus Dossier includes more than a dozen declarations from Syrians stating that while they owned certain companies on paper, the true owner was a regime insider.

The U.N. country team told ICIJ that U.N. agencies’ due diligence included efforts to verify companies’ ownership. It said that Syria’s official corporate registries “were not useful as a reliable source,” so its process also relied on other sources of information, including open-source intelligence and media reporting.

For some, however, the United Nations’ due diligence hasn’t gone far enough.

“[U.N. agencies] have not, either deliberately or because of neglect, done the due diligence to investigate these contracts,” said a former U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive issues. “If they say that this was a complex environment, I expect the U.N. to do their bloody work on the ground to investigate this complex environment and to really know who is behind whom.”
