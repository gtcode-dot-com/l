The founding director of Eswatini’s Farmers Bank has accused Swazi Bridge, a news outlet operating in exile, of defamation in a nearly $10 million lawsuit
[press freedom advocates](https://cpj.org/2025/11/in-eswatini-abusive-lawsuit-demands-a-record-9-8-mln-for-defamation/)
have labeled “abusive.”

In the lawsuit, Farmers Bank and its founder, John Asfar, claim that Swazi Bridge published a series of defamatory articles about alleged irregularities in the acquisition of the bank’s licence “with absolutely no evidence” and “without hearing the Plaintiffs’ side.”

Asfar is a real estate developer and the former owner of the Canadian hotel chain Travellers Inn, which filed for bankruptcy in 2009. He featured in ICIJ’s 2024
[Swazi Secrets investigation](https://www.icij.org/investigations/swazi-secrets/eswatini-farmers-bank-rijkenberg-belumbu/)
, a collaboration with seven media partners based on a leaked trove of documents from the Eswatini Financial Intelligence Unit.

Asfar has been at the center of a battle for control of Farmers Bank, which struggled to get off the ground amid a tussle with the Central Bank of Eswatini over its license and alleged political pressure to force the regulator’s hand. Swazi Secrets revealed that officials at the central bank were concerned about who ultimately controlled the new venture and its source of funds.

Swazi Bridge’s reporting, published between 2023 and 2025, includes

. Asfar has accused the outlet of “exhibiting an ulterior motive” and seeking to prevent Farmers Bank from operating in the tiny landlocked country, according to court records.

In a June letter, sent less than two months after the lawsuit was filed at a court in Eswatini’s capital of Mbabane, lawyers for Asfar and Farmers Bank proposed a settlement in which ownership of Swazi Bridge would be transferred to their clients. They also demanded the outlet retract the series of articles.

The lawyers warned that if Swazi Bridge did not agree to those terms, they would seek an injunction “followed by other punitive relief and costs.” They also threatened to have Swazi Bridge investigated for “domestic and/or foreign terrorism,” claiming “the commercial banking sector is a matter of national security.”

Swazi Bridge’s lawyers rejected the settlement terms, writing: “Our client would like to make it unequivocally clear that it is not for sale and will not, under any circumstances, surrender its institutional identity, editorial independence, or ownership rights.”

The outlet’s editor Manqoba Nxumalo told ICIJ he stood by the accuracy of its reporting, adding that Asfar had “picked on Swazi Bridge because it does not have the financial resources to fight him in court all the way.”

Nxumalo said the case was “a clear [SLAPP] suit and an abuse of the court process,” referring to costly litigation brought by powerful people or entities to intimidate and silence critics.

At the time of ICIJ’s Swazi Secrets reporting, Asfar accused the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit of “financial terrorism” and threatened to sue.

In response to ICIJ’s questions about the litigation against Swazi Bridge, Asfar sent a 2,000-word letter accusing ICIJ of spreading a “false narrative” and being the “tip-of-the-spear” in a Masonic plot to install an international government.

He claimed that Swazi Bridge published “narratives and malicious defamatory articles at will, and without investigating the facts/truth, they rather perpetuated lies from the other rouge [sic] activist publications.”

In a joint
[statement](https://www.southernafricalitigationcentre.org/slapps-a-threat-to-freedom-of-expression-and-press-freedom-in-eswatini/)
, two regional press freedom groups, the Southern Africa Litigation Centre and the Media Institute of Southern Africa, said the legal action “has the hallmarks of a SLAPP suit” and “targets speech concerning a matter of public interest.”

“Now is the moment to strengthen our legal frameworks and foster a culture of responsibility so meaningful public discourse can flourish,” the statement said.
