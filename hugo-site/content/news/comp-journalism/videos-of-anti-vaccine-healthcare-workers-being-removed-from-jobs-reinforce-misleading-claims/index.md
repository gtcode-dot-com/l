Several videos of anti-vaccine medical workers recording themselves being suspended or fired from their jobs at healthcare facilities have generated significant interest in the past few days.

Most physicians and healthcare workers in the United States have received Covid-19 vaccines. In a June survey, the
[American Medical Association](https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/2021-06/physician-vaccination-study-topline-report.pdf)
reported that 96 percent of physicians have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. And in earlier surveys of thousands of members, the
[American Nurses Association](https://www.nursingworld.org/news/news-releases/2021/ew-survey-data--nurses-recommend-covid-19-vaccines/)
and the
[American Association of Nurse Practitioners](https://storage.aanp.org/www/documents/no-index/research/Vaccine-Data-Membership-Survey-Executive-Summary.pdf)
reported that most of their members had received the vaccines.

In one video, which had been viewed over 7 million times on Twitter before the account was suspended, a San Diego-area nurse filmed herself being escorted out of a medical facility after refusing to take the Covid-19 vaccine for religious reasons. The nurse told a San Diego television station she believed her “God-given immune system” was good enough to fight Covid-19. In addition to its spread on social media and amplification by influencers, the video also received coverage from news organizations and digital outlets such as The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Newsday and the right-wing One America News Network.

Similarly, in another video, a healthcare worker at a Los Angeles hospital was escorted out for his refusal to receive what he called “the experimental vaccine,”

. The video, shared by a Facebook Page based in South Africa, has received at least 3.5 million views since last weekend. These viral videos

show how misleading claims from healthcare workers — even if they have no training in epidemiology or vaccine science — can resonate because due to their profession, they are perceived as experts. —
