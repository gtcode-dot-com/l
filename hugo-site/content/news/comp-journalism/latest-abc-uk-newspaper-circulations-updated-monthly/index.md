Sunday People front page on 11 August 2024

The Sunday People saw its average weekly print circulation decline by 26.4% year on year to 36,594 in November.

The paper has seen the biggest year-on-year drop among the UK’s publicly-audited national newspapers for many months this year, but this is the first time in 2025 the paper has decreased by more than a quarter.

The next biggest year-on-year drops were all at Sunday titles: Sunday Express (down 22.6% to 90,534), Sunday Mirror (down 22% to 120,702), Sunday Mail (down 21.9% to 34,573).

The Daily Express saw the biggest drop in circulation year on year among daily nationals, falling 19.6% to 104,737 average issues.

The paper also fared the worst in its year-on-year weekday and Saturday circulation figures in November, decreasing by 20% for its weekday edition (to 96,394) and 19% for its Saturday edition (to 146,294).

The Daily Express also recorded the biggest weekday circulation drop year on year in October (down 20% to 97,319 average issues) and in September (down 19% to 99,861).

The Daily Star also saw its weekday paper decline by 20% year on year to 93,252 average issues.

Free titles City AM and Metro were the only papers to record an increase in circulation: City AM saw a 1% boost in year on year circulation, recording an average of 68,587 issues. Its circulation remained stable at 0% month on month.

Metro saw an increase of 0.9% month on month in November, to 950,798 average issues.

**National newspaper circulations in November 2025 (ABC) with monthly and yearly changes – this page will be updated monthly:**

The column for bulks refers to copies which are circulated for free at venues such as airports and hotels.

The above figures do not include the Sun, Times and Telegraph titles which have all chosen to keep their ABC circulations private since the start of 2020. The Guardian and Observer joined them in September 2021.

The last ABC figures we have for these titles are as follows:

* The Sun: 1,210,915 (March 2020)
* The Sun on Sunday: 1,013,777 (March 2020)
* The Sunday Times: 647,622 (March 2020)
* The Times: 365,880 (March 2020)
* Daily Telegraph: 317,817 (December 2019)
* Sunday Telegraph: 248,288 (December 2019)
* The Observer: 136,656 (July 2021)
* The Guardian: 105,134 (July 2021)

If these titles have fallen in line with rest of the industry their current circulations as of October 2025 would be as follows (these are ball-park estimates):

* The Sun: 550,000
* The Sun on Sunday: 500,000
* The Sunday Times: 260,000
* The Times: 140,000
* Daily Telegraph: 150,000
* Sunday Telegraph: 100,000
* The Observer: 80,000
* The Guardian: 60,000

We have also charted the longer-term change in
[ABC](https://www.abc.org.uk/)
circulation over the past 20 years across the UK press.

These charts show the extent of the print decline from The Sun reaching 3.76m in 2000 and the Sun on Sunday’s launch in February 2012 with a short-lived 3.21m before dropping to just above 2m.

Meanwhile, though the Daily Mirror and Daily Mail once were competitive in print reach at around 2.3m-2.4m in 2000, the Mail now has a circulation three times the size of its former rival.

The Sunday tabloids all saw a spike in 2011 after the closure of the News of the World but few retained the readers – the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror did best at doing so, but largely lost them when the Sun on Sunday launched.

### October 2025

Five national newspapers saw both their weekday and Saturday circulations decline by double digits year on year in October 2025.

These five were the Daily Express, Daily Star, Daily Mirror, Daily Record and the Financial Times.

Across weekday circulation, the Daily Express recorded the biggest year-on-year fall, down 20% to 97,319 average issues. It follows the title also seeing the largest weekday circulation drop in September (down 19% to 99,861).

Next were the Daily Star (down 19% to 94,528) and Daily Mirror (down 18% to 158,521).

The Daily Mirror declined the most in Saturday newspaper circulation, down 18% year on year to 225,257, followed by the Daily Express (150,370) and Daily Record (46,931), both down 17%. The Daily Record had the lowest weekday (36,487) and Saturday circulations.

The Financial Times also saw double-digit declines across its weekday (40,213) and Saturday (83,977) circulation, down 10% and 11% year on year respectively.

The Daily Mail continues to have the highest Saturday circulation (1,046,644), despite a 7% year-on-year decrease, and the highest weekday circulation (down 8% to 531,607).

Across all national newspapers that provide ABC figures the biggest year-on-year declines were among Sunday titles.

Reach’s Sunday People saw the steepest drop year on year by almost a quarter (24.2%) to 37,897 average circulation per issue.

This was followed by the Sunday Express, down 20.8% year on year to 92,727, and the Sunday Mirror, down 20.7% to 124,090.

On a monthly basis, The i Paper saw circulation fall the most, down 4.5% to 111,169 average circulation per issue. Its bulks also decreased significantly month on month, from 3,966 to 984.

Free title City AM was the only paper on record to see a year-on-year boost in circulation, up 1.1% to 68,602. Month on month it remained stable at 0%.

Meanwhile, free newspaper Metro was the only paper to see a month-on-month increase in circulation (up 5.7%), and had the highest overall average circulation at 942,571.

However, this indicates the paper is levelling out after slimming down its free distribution in August to 640,497. In September, Metro saw a larger month-on-month increase of 32.9% to 891,386.

Before reducing circulation in August, it had been distributing at least 950,000 copies a day since June 2021.

### September 2025

The Mirror, Daily Star and Daily Record all saw double-digit declines in both weekday and Saturday newspaper circulations in September 2025.

The Daily Express saw the biggest year-on-year decline in weekday circulation (down 19% to 99,861), according to the latest audited ABC figures, while the Daily Mirror saw the biggest fall in Saturday circulation (down 17% to 226,041).

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail had the highest Saturday circulation (1,050,074), at least four times higher than the Daily Mirror (226,041), and almost double its own weekday circulation – demonstrating the
[widening gulf between weekday and Saturday UK newspaper sales.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/media-audience-and-business-data/media_metrics/uk-national-newspaper-saturday-circulation-versus-weekdays-sundays/)

Sunday papers had the biggest year-on-year circulation declines with the Reach-owned Sunday People down 24.4% to 38,108 in September and the Sunday Express down 20.9% to 93,754.

Meanwhile, Metro saw the biggest month-on-month increase in circulation, up 32.9% to 891,386, after it slimmed down its free distribution in August to 640,497.

However, it is still below its previous average: before reducing circulation in August, it had been distributing at least 950,000 copies a day since June 2021.

The Financial Times also saw a month-on-month circulation boost by 4.8% to 104,971, despite its bulks decreasing from 27,217 in August to 26,861 in September. The only other paper to increase month on month was DC Thomson’s Sunday Post, up 0.2% to 27,727.

DMG’s titles Metro, Daily Mail (625,221) and Mail on Sunday (530,768) sit at the top of the table with highest circulation figures overall, though each saw year-on-year declines (down 6.3%, 7.1% and 6.7% respectively).

### August 2025

Metro put out 30% less copies on average per day in August as it slimmed down its print run for the summer.

Metro had an average free distribution of 670,497 in August, according to the latest audited ABC figures, compared to at least 950,000 each day since June 2021.

Press Gazette understands the decision was made to reduce the number of Metro copies being put out in August due to seasonality and commuter habits during the summer, but that it has returned to 950,000+ in September.

Among paid-for national newspapers, the Financial Times saw the biggest month-on-month drop (down 3.1%) but smallest year-on-year decline (of 4.5%) with a print circulation of 100,162.

Three of Metro’s DMG Media sister titles were narrowly up in August compared to July: The i Paper was up 0.9% month on month to a print circulation of 117,173, the Mail on Sunday was up 0.5% to 538,468 and the Daily Mail was up 0.4% to 630,202. They also all saw single-digit year-on-year decline of 7.2%, 6.9% and 7.6% respectively.

The biggest year-on-year decrease in print circulation was at the Sunday People (down 22.9% to 40,060) followed by the Sunday Express (down 20% to 97,098).

The Sunday tabloids all saw a spike in 2011 after the closure of the News of the World but few retained the readers – the Sunday People and Sunday Mirror did best at doing so, but largely lost them when the Sun on Sunday launched.

### July 2025

The Financial Times saw the smallest year-on-year print circulation decline among the publicly audited UK national newspapers in July.

The latest ABC figures show the Financial Times was down 4.4% compared to July 2024 to an average print circulation of 103,343.

The FT is the only newspaper in the table whose circulation includes a large global print run (53% of its total) and a sizeable percentage of bulk copies distributed at airports, hotels and other locations (27%).

Both the Daily Star and Sunday People regained their previous places in our table after moving below the Financial Times and Daily Record respectively in June.

The Daily Star saw month-on-month change of 0.2%, to an average circulation of 103,882 in July putting it back above the FT.

The Sunday People was also up 0.2% to 40,761 meaning it went back above the Daily Record in the table which was down 1.5% month on month to 40,110.

However The Sunday People again had the biggest year-on-year drop, as it has done in many recent months, down 22.1% compared to July 2024.

The biggest increase in the month was the Daily Star Sunday, up 1.4% compared to June, with a circulation of 55,810.

### June 2025

The Daily Star and Sunday People have both moved down a place in Press Gazette’s monthly table of UK national newspapers by ABC print circulation.

The
[Daily Star](https://pressgazette.co.uk/subject/daily-star/)
, owned by Reach, saw a month-on-month print decline of 3% in June and a year-on-year drop of 17% to 103,730.

This meant it moved below the Financial Times, which was on 104,223 (up 0.5% month on month and down 6% year on year, the smallest annual drop among the newspapers publicly audited by ABC).

[The Daily Star announced a revamp and redesign in June promising to deliver “news with a wink” and “focus on more exclusive content for our readers”.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/daily-star-drops-page-three-pictures-of-women-in-redesign/)
The changes also included ditching page three models and a new logo.

Meanwhile weekly tabloid the Sunday People, also owned by Reach, was down by 5% compared to May and 24% compared to June 2024 putting it on an average circulation of 40,688 in June.

This meant it fell below Reach’s Scottish newspaper title the Daily Record, which was steady month on month and fell 17% year on year to 40,736.

### May 2025

The Daily Star Sunday was the only UK national newspaper to see print circulation growth in May.

The Reach title’s circulation was up 0.6% month on month to 57,425 in May. However its typical rate of annual decline continued, dropping by 17%.

The i Paper was ahead of the Daily Express for the first time in April and continued to be so in May.

The i Paper was down 1.3% month on month and 5.7% year on year to 117,804 while the Daily Express was down by 1% and 16.2% respectively to 117,789.

The biggest year-on-year circulation decline was again at The Sunday People, down 21.1% to 42,700 along with Scottish paper the Sunday Mail down 21.2% to 38,076.

### April 2025

Several UK national newspapers avoided month-on-month print circulation decline in April, according to the latest ABC figures.

The Daily Record saw 1.9% growth compared to March, with an average print circulation of 42,479.

Others to stay steady or see marginal growth were the Mail on Sunday (up 0.3% to 544, 900), Daily Mail (0.2%, 650,235), The i Paper (0.2%, 119,395), Sunday Mail (0.2%, 39,361) and Daily Mirror (0%, 196,897).

However, every paid-for title continued to see year-on-year decline. The smallest was at the Financial Times (down 3.6% to 105,885) and The i Paper (down 5.4%).

The Sunday People continued to be the newspaper with the biggest annual circulation decline (down 20.6% to 44,096). Several titles were down by about 18%: the Daily Star Sunday (57,065), the Daily Express (119,020), the Daily Record, the Sunday Mail and the Sunday Express (103,853).

### March 2025

Reach tabloid The Sunday People saw the biggest annual print circulation decline among the UK’s publicly-audited national newspapers in March.

The Sunday People had an average circulation of 44,140, which was down by 3.5% compared to February and by 22.8% compared to March 2024.

The biggest month-on-month decline was at Reach title for Scotland the Daily Record, down 3.8% to 41,676 (with decline of 19.6% year on year).

The Financial Times was the only paid-for title to see month-on-month growth, up 1% to 107,936.

It also had the smallest year-on-year decline, down 1.1%. The FT’s ABC circulation is notably different from other papers, however, with 52% coming from outside the UK and 28.7% made up of bulk copies distributed in locations like airports and hotels.

### February 2025

The print circulation of the Daily Mirror dropped below 200,000 in February for the first time since the Edwardian era.

The Daily Mirror saw its print circulation decline to 196,150, a drop of 4.5% compared to January and of 16.4% since February 2024.

Sister title the Sunday Mirror was down 1.5% month on month and 17.3% year on year to 144,733.

[The Daily Mirror’s cover price has more than doubled since 2010 to £1.70 per day,](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/uk-newspaper-cover-prices-2025/)
a tactic which has defended circulation revenue while at the same time possibly hastening decline.

After a reshuffle in our monthly ranking in January due to the Sunday Express falling below the Financial Times by print circulation, the titles are back in their previous positions.

The Sunday Express had a smaller month-on-month drop of 0.9% to 107,838 although it was down 16.8% year on year.

The Financial Times, which includes bulk copies in locations like airports and hotels and global print readership in its ABC figure, was down 2.8% month on month and 1.2% year on year to 106,871.

The biggest monthly drop was at the Daily Mail, down 5% to 652,866.

The smallest year-on-year drop among paid titles was at The i Paper, down 5.3% to 119,333.

The Mail titles also report their digital editions separately. The Daily Mail had 92,308 active views in February while the Mail on Sunday had 95,829.

### January 2025

The Daily Mail’s print circulation has increased month on month for the second month in a row.

The Daily Mail was read by an average of 687,063 people each day in January 2025, up 2% month on month to its highest ABC print circulation since May last year.

The paper’s circulation was down 7% year on year.

Also up month on month was the Daily Express, where print circulation was up 1% to 128,551.

The i saw the smallest year-on-year drop among paid-for titles, down 3% to 122,487.

Also this month the Sunday Express saw its total print distribution fall below that of the Financial Times for the first time since ABC records are available (going back to 2000). Although these newspapers are not directly comparable, the change represents a reshuffling in the order of our monthly table.

The Sunday Express declined by 3% month on month and 17% year on year to 108,870.

The circulation of the Financial Times in January was 109,995, up 1% month on month and down 5% year on year. However 52% of the FT’s ABC audited circulation is non-UK. In addition 28% of its circulation is from bulk copies (which are paid for but distributed free of charge to consumers in locations like airports and hotels).

Like-for-like, including only paid newsstand sales and subscriptions in the UK, the Sunday Express is still ahead on 108,772 to the FT’s 21,720.
