Here in Washington, D.C., the passing of Thanksgiving and the onset of December marks Christmas party season (some of these shindigs are called "holiday" parties, but they're Christmas parties). That means from now through roughly December 19, the last Friday before Christmas, you can't be sure that your favorite D.C. restaurant or venue isn't closed for a private party, where members of Congress, lobbyists, political operatives, and, yes, journalists are connecting, reconnecting, talking shop and swapping valuable information, all while toasting to good cheer.

Nonetheless, the news doesn't stop—it hasn't stopped, in case you hadn't noticed. And that means
*The Dispatch*
hasn’t stopped, either. Here is some of our favorite commentary and reporting so far this month.
