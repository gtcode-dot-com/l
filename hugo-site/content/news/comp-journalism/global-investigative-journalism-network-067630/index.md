#### Location

#### Deadline

January 16, 2026

The Examination is seeking an experienced reporter with a track record of producing impactful stories to join our growing food team. This is a role for someone with a collaborative mindset who is passionate about investigating an industry whose products are among the leading causes of preventable disease and early deaths worldwide.

In this position, you will shape, report, and craft stories about the role of the food industry and other powerful actors that contribute to the global burden of diet-related disease. Guided by science and verification of evidence, you will work closely with the food team to report on corporate wrongdoing, misleading marketing campaigns, regulatory failures and other forces that undermine public health.

Our food team has produced investigations that have led to a crackdown by U.S. consumer protection authorities and stronger transparency standards for social media influencers. We’ve revealed how the food and beverage industries paid popular dietitians to downplay the health risks of highly processed foods and to push unproven supplements, how oversight failures allowed lead-tainted spices to sail through the food safety system, and how industry influence has shaped global negotiations to reduce noncommunicable diseases.

As a member of the food team, you will work closely with your colleagues to develop agenda-setting coverage of a sector at the center of global public health challenges. Your responsibilities will vary from shaping and producing major investigations to writing accountability news stories and contributing to The Examination’s weekly newsletter. Though the scale and pace of those stories will vary, you will deliver them in a timely and consistent manner.

This is a beat that affects everyone’s lives and sparks passionate public discussion. The ideal candidate will bring expertise that will help us report in innovative ways and expand our ability to produce stories in multiple formats that resonate with global audiences and shape debate.
