US-based newsbrands led month-on-month audience growth in the UK in November, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

News network CNN, entertainment website Screenrant and business-focused publisher Forbes all saw the biggest month-on-month increases in their monthly audience.

CNN (up 26% to 3.3 million people), Screenrant (up 25% to 2.8 million) and Forbes (up 17% to 4.9 million) were three of only four sites to see double-digit boosts month on month.

The fourth was UK-based product review site Which?, up 10.9% to 4.7 million.

Screenrant (up 49.8% to 4.8 million minutes), Forbes (up 24.8% to 7.9 million minutes) and Which? (up 24.4% to 32.1 million minutes) also saw the biggest month-on-month growth in time spent with their content.

Some 21 of the biggest newsbrands in the UK saw audience growth month on month, while 28 newsbrands saw a year-on-year increase – down from 33 in October.

The biggest month-on-month audience decline was Bristol Live for the second month in a row, down 21% to 2.8 million people. This follows it falling 29% month on month to 3.6 million in October.

Healthline Media followed this decrease with an 18% decline month on month to an audience of 4.4 million.

The US-based health publisher also saw the biggest year-on-year fall in audience, down 40.9%, followed by GB News (down 39.7% to 5.4 million).

GB News remained stagnant month on month with 0% growth in visitors compared to October, alongside ITV, Ok and Yahoo!.

The Daily Star, which has undergone a
[year of change under editor-in-chief Ben Rankin](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/daily-star-2025-growth-ben-rankin-editor-interview/)
, continued to see the strongest year-on-year growth, with a 147.8% increase in audience to eight million.

Seven out of the ten sites with the biggest year-on-year audience growth were similarly owned by Reach, with Chronicle Live recording the second biggest increase at 57.5% to 4.6 million.

Time Out saw the biggest year-on-year drop in time spent among Press Gazette’s top 50 list, down 58% to 4.3 million minutes with its content in November.

This was followed by celebrity magazine Ok (down 49% to 7.7 million minutes) and Screenrant (down 47% to 4.8 million minutes).

Compared to October, IGN saw the biggest decline in engagement with a 26.8% month-on-month fall in minutes (to 17.3 million), followed by Channel 4 (down 22.2% to 696.5 million) and Healthline Media (down 21.1% to 7.5 million).

More than half (27) of the top 50 newsbrands saw year-on-year boost in minutes spent with their content in November. The biggest of these were Daily Star (up 180% to 30.5 million minutes), Substack (up 143% to 49.2 million minutes) and Daily Express (up 94% to 129.8 million minutes).

All of the ten biggest newsbrands in the UK saw year-on-year audience growth in November, the same as in October.

The Daily Express saw the biggest year-on-year audience growth once again, up 25.4% to 16.9 million. This was followed by The Telegraph (up 20.3% to 17.8 million).

The Mirror saw the biggest increase in audience month on month, up 4.2% to 20.3 million. This is despite the title being understood to have been
[among the hardest-hit titles by redundancies at Reach in the autumn](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/mirror-journalists-back-strike-action-over-redundancies-and-ai/)
.

Six of the top ten brands saw month-on-month decline, an increase from four in October.

The Daily Mail was the hardest hit, down 4.6% to 18.5 million, followed by The Guardian (21.9 million) and Daily Express, both down 2.3%.

The Independent (down 1.2% to 20.7 million), BBC (down 1.1% to 40.9 million) and Yahoo! (down 0.4% to 17.3 million) also saw small decline month on month.

The
[Ipsos iris](https://iris.ipsos.com/)
data measures the total unduplicated number of people who used a brand’s websites and apps in a given month and includes all traffic, not necessarily just news. Reach and minutes for brands such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, which have a strong entertainment offering in addition to news content, will therefore be higher.

Brands such as Apple and Google, while well-known names in news, are excluded from our list given the wide reach of their non-news content. Google News and Apple News are not reported by Ipsos as separate entities in brand-level data.

Ipsos iris replaced Comscore as the industry-recognised standard in 2021. Ipsos iris data is partly derived from a panel of 10,000 people aged 15 and over that is designed to be nationally representative. The participants have meters installed across 25,000 personal devices to passively measure website and app usage. This is combined with data from participating websites that are tagged so all devices visiting the site can be identified and logged.

## October 2025

The Daily Star continued its run of strong year-on-year audience growth in October, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

The Daily Star grew its monthly audience by 136% year on year to 7.5 million in October.

It was the 23rd biggest newsbrand in the UK by audience, compared to 48th a year earlier.

The second-biggest year-on-year audience growth was at Cosmopolitan, up 59% to 4.3 million.

On a month-on-month basis, two celebrity magazines saw the biggest growth: Ok (up 24% to 3 million) and Hello! (up 20% to 5.6 million).

Thirty of the 50 biggest newsbrands in the UK saw audience growth compared to September, while 33 recorded year-on-year growth.

The biggest month-on-month audience decline was at Bristol Live (down 29% to 3.6 million) followed by CNN (down 27% to 2.6 million).

Forbes reported the largest year-on-year audience drop, down 47% to 4.2 million – although it saw small month-on-month growth of 3%.

Forbes also saw the biggest year-on-year drop in minutes spent with its content, down 56% to 6.3 million.

Forbes CEO Sherry Phillips told Press Gazette in November
[the brand is focusing on its core communities, including via events, as Google AI Overviews hit traffic.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news-leaders/interview-how-forbes-ceo-sherry-phillips-is-responding-to-google-challenge/)

Despite the audience and minutes drop, Forbes did see growth in its page views in October. It was up 14% compared to September to 9.4 million page views in the UK.

Time Out saw the second-biggest year-on-year drop in minutes spent among Press Gazette’s top 50 list, and the biggest drop compared to September. A total of 5.3 million minutes were spent with its content in October, down 34% month on month and 53% year on year.

Some 36 of the top 50 list saw month-on-month growth in minutes spent with their content, led by Channel 4 (up 43% to 895.5 million including non-news streaming content) and entertainment brand IGN (up 36% to 23.6 million minutes).

Meanwhile 30 saw year-on-year minutes growth, dominated by the Daily Star (up 160% to 32.7 million minutes) and Substack (up 159% to 44.7 million).

Among the top ten for audience, the Daily Express saw the biggest growth both month on month (up 8.6%) and year on year (up 34.2%) to 17.3 million people.

Every top-ten brand saw audience growth compared to October 2024, with the smallest growth at Sky News (up 0.9% to 18.7 million).

Month on month, four of the top-ten newsbrands were down: The Independent (by 0.1%, to 21 million), The Guardian (by 2.3% to 22.5 million, although it remained the top commercial newsbrand), The Telegraph (down 4% to 17.3 million) and Yahoo! (down 4.6%, also to 17.3 million).

## September 2025

The Daily Star reported the biggest year-on-year growth in audience and minutes spent with its content in September among the 50 biggest news websites in the UK, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

Minutes spent with the Daily Star increased by 160% year on year to 29.4 million, while its audience was up by 150.4% to 7.7 million.

Compared to August, which was the best month the newsbrand has had, the Daily Star’s audience was down 6% and minutes spent were down 16%.

Editor-in-chief Ben Rankin told Press Gazette last month October could match August for audience but that he does not expect “the numbers just to go up and up and up and up every month”.

He said the growth can be
[credited to “all the little things” the team are doing amid a major revamp and focus on digital transformation this year.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/daily-star-2025-growth-ben-rankin-editor-interview/)

Behind the Daily Star, the second and third best newsbrands for year-on-year growth in minutes spent also remained the same from August, with Substack (up 151% to 41.9 million minutes) and Bristol Live (up 131% to 12.2 million) ranking behind it.

Twenty-one brands saw a year-on-year decline in minutes spent in September, compared to 39 in August.

However more than half (30) saw a month-on-month dip, despite August traditionally being a slower news month than September.

Several brands re-entered the top 50 news websites in the UK when ranked by audience in September.

CNN was back on the list, having dropped off in March, and recorded the biggest monthly increase in audience, up 60% to 3.6 million, plus a 6.9% increase year on year.

The US broadcaster was also second for month-on-month growth in total minutes spent (up 46% to 15.7 million minutes) behind Channel 4 (up 55% to 627.2 million).

Other brands to re-enter the top 50 by audience reach included LBC (monthly increase of 16% to 3.2 million people) and Nottinghamshire Live (7% increase to 2.6 million).

Screenrant, Kent Online and the Oxford Mail were not included in the top 50 by audience reach in September, despite featuring in August.

Each of the top ten brands saw year-on-year audience growth in September: The Telegraph climbed 23% to 18 million, followed by Daily Express (22.7% to 16 million) and The Guardian (17.4% to 23 million).

Half of the top ten saw a month-on-month decrease in audience in September, an improvement from August when all of them did so.

The Daily Express saw the highest month-on-month decrease of 5%, a slight improvement on August’s 6.6% reduction.

GB News saw the biggest year-on-year fall in audience growth (down 45.3% to 4.9 million), followed by Forbes (down 44.6% to four million) and Healthline Media (down 35.2% to five million).

Reach titles dominated the top ten for year-on-year audience growth: Daily Star, Cosmopolitan (up 85.1% to 4.1 million visitors), Bristol Live (82% to 5.1 million), Examiner Live (75.9% to 5.6 million), Chronicle Live (70.6% to 4.7 million), My London (58.5% to 3.3 million), Liverpool Echo (48.2% to 7.8 million) and Wales Online (38.5% to 7.9 million).

## August 2025

Minutes spent with the Daily Star saw the strongest boost among the UK’s 50 biggest news websites in August, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

Some 34.9 million minutes were spent with the Reach-owned site in August, ranking the newsbrand 26th on this metric out of the 50 top sites in the UK.

This was up 177.6% year on year, the biggest growth in minutes recorded, and 27% month on month, narrowly the second-biggest growth in minutes compared to July behind Newsquest’s Oxford Mail (up 27.5% to 3.7 million).

Users averaged four minutes each with the Daily Star, which
[announced a revamp and redesign in June promising to deliver “news with a wink” and “focus on more exclusive content for our readers”.](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/nationals/daily-star-drops-page-three-pictures-of-women-in-redesign/)

Meanwhile, Substack continued its year-on-year growth, with a 133.1% boost year on year to 38.6 million minutes. This is following a boost of 286% in July.

Among the top ten newsbrands by total minutes, New York Times saw both the biggest year-on-year boost (37.7%) and month-on-month increase (4.9%) to 485.5 million minutes.

Of the top 50 newsbrands based on audience reach, 39 saw a decline in minutes spent compared to July, with 29 down year on year.

All top ten newsbrands saw audience declines in August by a month-on-month basis, with Sky News seeing the biggest drop at 17.1% to 17.7 million. In July, it ranked top for month-month growth (9%). Sky News also had the biggest year-on-year fall among the top ten by 13.5%.

This meant Sky News fell from fifth place in the overall top 50 in July to seventh.

The Guardian saw the second biggest month-on-month audience decline among the top ten of 8.1% to 21.6 million, followed by the Daily Express (6.6% fall to 16.8 million) and The Sun (6.5% to 21.1 million).

The Oxford Mail (audience of 3.4 million) was a new entrant into the overall top 50 ranking with growth of 52.3% month on month and 216% year on year. Newsquest CEO Henry Faure Walker
[told Press Gazette the title has “a very strong news team there, particularly adept and skilled at digital journalism”](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/regional-newspapers/focus-on-local-not-trending-news-fuels-record-newsquest-digital-growth/)
after achieving 11.4 million page views – up by more than 100% year on year.

Screenrant re-entered the top-50 ranking by audience, while LBC, Irish Mirror and Ok! dropped out in August. Irish Mirror was a new entrant in July.

Meanwhile Kent Online, a new entrant in July, saw an audience of 3.1 million and no change month on month, but a 28.1% increase year on year.

Substack climbed to 46
th
place having secured 48
th
spot when it re-entered the ranking last month. It was steady month on month with an audience of 3.1 million, but was up 52.8% compared to August 2024.

Fourteen newsbrands saw month-on-month growth in August, with Oxford Mail (up 52.3%), The Scotsman (37.6%) and Time Out (13.2%) leading the way, while 30 out of 50 saw year on year growth.

Despite recording the highest engagement in August, Daily Star ranked seventh in month-on-month audience growth in August with a 4.4% increase – though this was down 19.3% compared to July.

The Oxford Mail’s year-on-year growth was followed by the Daily Star (up 91.1% to 8.2 million) and Reach title Bristol Live (up 90.5% to 5.7 million).

The Oxford Mail (3.7 million minutes) also saw the highest month-on-month growth of total minutes spent in August at 27.5% to 3.7 million. The Daily Star ranked second, up 27% to 34.9 million minutes.

## July 2025

Minutes spent with Substack writers and publications in the UK have grown by almost 300% in the past year, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

Some 45.8 million minutes were spent with Substack content in the UK in July, up 286% compared to July 2024 (but down 5% compared to June).

This put Substack 24th out of the 50 biggest news websites in the UK when ranked by their total minutes in July.

People spent an average of 15 minutes each with Substack – putting it in 12th place by this metric and just behind The Sun on 16 minutes per person.

When ranked by total audience, Substack was in 48th place having re-entered the top 50 table in July. It had an audience of 3.1 million in July, up 3% month on month and 43% year on year.

This put it roughly equal with fellow new entrants Kent Online (3.1 million, up 8% month on month and 27% year on year) and the Irish Mirror (3 million, up 26% and 25% respectively).

Overall 30 out of the top 50 news websites saw growth in minutes spent with them in July, with 22 up year on year.

Looking at total audience, 29 saw month-on-month growth and 29 (but not all the same sites) grew year on year.

Among the top ten sites by audience, the Daily Express (tenth place) saw the biggest growth of 16% compared to July 2024 – although it was 3% down compared to June.

The largest month-on-month growth among the top ten sites was at Sky News, up 9% to 21.4 million (but down 6% compared to July 2024).

This meant Sky News overtook both the Mirror and Daily Mail to sit in fifth place. The Mirror (20.9 million) was up 1% month on month but down 5% year on year while the Daily Mail was down 1% and 10% respectively.

Despite its audience boost, Sky News saw a 13% month on month and 28% year on year drop in total minutes spent with its content to 546.3 million minutes.

This meant it was overtaken by Channel 4, which moved into seventh place by this metric on 620.6 million following growth of 22% and 27% respectively. The rest of the top ten ranked by minutes spent stayed the same.

Among the whole top 50, the Irish Mirror saw the biggest month-on-month audience growth followed by the Daily Star (up 24% to 7.9 million) and Cosmopolitan (up 22% to 3.9 million).

On a year-on-year basis, Reach regionals Devon Live (up 152% to 5.2 million) and Examiner Live (up 105% to 6.6 million) saw the biggest boost, followed by Good Housekeeping (up 98% to 5.4 million). Substack was in seventh place.

## June 2025

The Guardian is again the biggest commercial newsbrand in the UK by audience size after a month behind The Sun, according to the latest data from Ipsos iris.

The Guardian was down 0.2% month on month in June to an audience of 22.6 million while The Sun was down 1.4% to 22.4 million. Compared to June 2024 they were up 12.5% and down 4.7% respectively.

The Daily Express was the biggest winner in the top ten by audience, rising by 2.2% month on month but 31% compared to June last year, reaching 18.5 million.

Reach sister title the Mirror was up 2.8% month on month but down 8% year on year to 20.7 million.

Mail Online (
[now being referred to as the Daily Mail](https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/digital-journalism/daily-mail-sets-1m-digital-subscriber-target-amid-major-rebrand/)
in the UK) was the biggest faller in the top ten by audience size, down 7% month on month to 20.3 million and moving down from fourth to sixth place (now behind the BBC, Guardian, Sun, Independent and Mirror).

However Mail Online stayed steady on engagement for the month, with total minutes spent staying steady month on month at 1.3 billion in June (although this was down 7.6% year on year) and page views down 1% month on month to 498.9 million.

Among the top ten for audience, more than half grew their minutes spent compared to May but eight out of ten were down year on year by this metric with the biggest drop at the Mirror (down 9.1% to 228.2 million minutes).

The exceptions were Yahoo! (minutes up 8.7% year on year to 1.8 billion) and The Independent (up 19.3% to 188 million).

Among the whole top 50, the biggest month-on-month growth in minutes spent was ITV (which, like the BBC, includes its entertainment offering) – up 26.1% to 934.2 million minutes spent in June, although it was down 34.3% year on year.

Two other broadcasters were also in the top ten for minutes growth: GB News was up 15.1% month on month to 54.4 million minutes while Sky News was up 10.8% to 627.7 million. GB News was also among the biggest growers year on year, up 89.5%.

The biggest month-on-month audience growth in June was at Reach regional Devon Live, which was up by a third to reach 5.3 million people.

It was followed by the Daily Star (up 18.1% to 6.4 million) and Time Out (up 14.9% to 4.7 million).

The biggest month-on-month audience declines were at Nottinghamshire Live (down 20.3% to 3.6 million) and Radio Times (down 18.7% to 6.1 million).

On a year-on-year basis nine of the top ten audience growers were Reach regionals, led by Surrey Live up 348.8% to 4.5 million. The only non-Reach title was Good Housekeeping, up 75.4% to 5 million.

The biggest year-on-year audience drop was Healthline Media, down 31.4% to 6.5 million, followed by Forbes which was down 19.3% to 5.3 million.

## May 2025

Two-thirds of the 50 biggest news websites in the UK saw audience growth in May, according to the latest Ipsos iris data.

However just half saw monthly growth in engagement via either total minutes spent or page views.

The tussle at the top of the ranking for audience reach among the four biggest commercial newsbrands continued with The Sun rising from fourth to second place behind only the BBC (reach of 40.8 million).

The Sun was up 4.3% month on month to 22.73 million but down 5% year on year.

Meanwhile the audience of The Guardian (22.68 million) and Mail Online (21.77 million) were up by a smaller 3.4% and 2.6% respectively compared to April, and The Independent (21.23 million) was down 2.7%.

Among the top ten, Sky News saw the biggest month-on-month growth of 15% to an audience of 19.5 million, meaning it rose from tenth to seventh place.

In total, eight of the top ten for audience reach saw month-on-month growth while half saw year-on-year growth, led by the Daily Express (up 22.6% to 18.11 million) and The Telegraph (up 20.4% to 18.18 million).

MSN and Yahoo data have been incorporated since April, which may have led to some variations.

Among the entire top 50, 33 saw month-on-month growth and 32 were up year on year.

Nottinghamshire Live saw the biggest month-on-month jump (up 62% to 4.6 million) while fellow Reach title Surrey Live was up 310.5% year on year to 5 million.

Four Reach websites saw their audience at least double in the past year. The biggest of these sites was Examiner Live in Huddersfield, up 200.4% to reach 9.2 million people in May. Nine of the ten biggest sites for year-on-year audience growth were owned by Reach, with Good Housekeeping (up 55.1% to 4.9 million) as the exception.

In terms of engagement, 26 of the top 50 saw their page views increase month on month, led by Nottinghamshire Live up 69.5% to 19.1 million. But Surrey Live saw the biggest drop, down 34.1% to 18.7 million.

Just over half (27) saw month on month growth in total minutes spent, led by Bristol Live up 126.5% to 18.2 million minutes in May.

The top ten news websites for total minutes spent stayed mostly the same except Channel 4 fell from fifth to seventh, down 10% month on month to 688.3 minutes.

Year on year, Surrey Live’s minutes were up 251.5% to 5.4 million while Forbes was down 43.3% to 7.2 million and Digital Spy was down 42.8% to 10.7 million.

## April 2025

The top four commercial newsbrands in the UK were neck-and-neck for audience in April, according to the latest Ipsos iris figures.

The Guardian (21.9 million, up 4% month on month and 7% year on year) jumped up a place to be the biggest behind the BBC (40.2 million, including non-news content at the same domain).

The Independent rose two places (21.8 million, up 13% MoM and 11% YoY) while The Sun stayed in fourth spot overall (21.8 million, up 6% MoM but down 7% YoY).

Mail Online fell from second place behind the BBC to fifth (21.2 million, flat month on month and down 6% year on year).

All four commercial newsbrands had an audience of within less than one million of each other.

The April 2025 audience reach and engagement figures from Ipsos iris include for the first time syndicated traffic via versions published on MSN and Yahoo! for the originator newsbrands. Not all publishers work with MSN and Yahoo! (for example The Sun).

Elsewhere among the top ten, the Daily Express saw the largest year-on-year growth of 39% to 17.4 million helping it to overtake Sky News (17 million, down 1% MoM and 6% YoY).

After entering Press Gazette’s top-50 audience ranking for the first time in March, Substack has dropped back out (it would be in 51
st
place). Although Substack continued to grow (up 4% month on month and 75% year on year) several other titles saw bigger growth and leapfrogged it to join the list.

They include Reach’s site for the UK capital, MyLondon, which re-entered the ranking in 38
th
place with an audience of 4.4 million (up 75% month on month and 61% year on year).

This was the biggest month-on-month growth, followed by fellow Reach title Belfast Live (up 42% to 3.7 million) and LBC (up 40% to 5.4 million).

On a year-on-year basis, Surrey Live – one of the Reach regionals to be benefitting from finding its topic niche within Google Discover – was up 405% to 4.8 million followed by three other Reach titles that more than doubled their monthly reach. Leicestershire Live was up 185% to 4.1 million, Leeds Live was up 156% to 4.3 million and Belfast Live was up 117%.

Two newsbrands saw their audience down by more than a fifth compared to March 2024: Digital Spy, down 27% to 4.5 million, and Healthline Media, down 24% to 6.8 million.

On a month-on-month basis, three brands were all down by 12%: Healthline Media, the Daily Record (audience of 7.5 million) and Devon Live (6.7 million).

In terms of engagement, MyLondon and Surrey Live also saw the biggest month-on-month growth in total minutes spent, up 128% (to 6.5 million minutes) and 63% (to 6.2 million) respectively.

Eight of the top-ten newsbrands by total minutes spent with their content saw a drop compared to March. The two exceptions were Channel 4 (which like the BBC includes non-news content), which was up 14% month on month to 764.8 million minutes, and The New York Times, up 10% to 468.9 million.

## March 2025

Substack entered Press Gazette’s ranking of the 50 biggest news websites in the UK in March.

The newsletter and website network saw its UK audience grow by a fifth between February and March and by 69% year on year to reach 3 million people according to Ipsos iris data.

This means Substack now reaches 6% of the UK population, more than US news website CNN which dropped off the top-50 list in March. Substack has entered the ranking in 49th place, above The Scotsman in 50th.

Just six news websites in Press Gazette’s monthly top-50 ranking saw bigger annual growth, of which five were regional brands also owned by parent company Reach and the sixth was Forbes.

With 136.9 million page views, Reach noted that the Express also “recorded its best page view month since July 2024, when it enjoyed a record-setting best ever month”.

Of the ten biggest news websites in the UK, eight saw month-on-month growth from December to January while half grew year on year.

Eight out of the ten biggest websites saw the minutes spent with their content decline between January 2024 and 2025. However all ten sites saw month-on-month growth in their minutes spent, indicating a more recent upwards trajectory.

The biggest year-on-year decline in minutes spent among the ten biggest sites was at The Guardian, down 28% to 761.3 million.

The Telegraph bucked the trend, with minutes up 20% year on year (and 10% month on month) to 883.6 million. It is the fifth biggest news website by total minutes spent even though it is tenth for total audience (15.6 million people in January).

The other exception was news aggregator Yahoo!, with total minutes spent in January up 16% (and 4% month on month) to 1.9 billion.

Of the ten sites, the biggest month-on-month growth in minutes spent was at Express sister title the Mirror, up 16% to 236.2 million minutes.

The biggest growth in minutes spent overall came at Reach regionals: Bristol Live on a month-on-month basis (up 56% to eight million) and Surrey Live year on year (up 202% to 5.6 million).

The biggest annual growth in audience was similarly at Surrey Live with a reach of 4.4 million people, up 320% in a year. Reach chief executive Jim Mullen noted in the company’s annual results on Tuesday that this growth was

On a month-on-month basis two Reach regionals again were top of the table for growth with Bristol Live up 60% to an audience of 5.7 million people in January and the Examiner Live in Huddersfield up 32% to 4.8 million. Behind them were the Financial Times (up 25% to 4.4 million) and Reuters (up 24% to 4.1 million).

David Higgerson, Reach’s chief digital publisher, said: “Building on a strong end to 2024, it’s great to see that over half of our sites are now in page view growth, year on year. What’s particularly meaningful about these numbers is not just that we’re getting more page views overall, but that our audience is choosing to come back to us more often, with page views per user up by 32%.

“It’s a very positive sign too that we’re attracting more under-35s, in large part thanks to more young people finding our content off platform.

“This is testament to a lot of the work that our teams have put into producing engaging content across a range of channels. The success of our Content Hub has also allowed our brands to spend more time deepening their relationships with their audiences, which we can see now bearing fruit.”
