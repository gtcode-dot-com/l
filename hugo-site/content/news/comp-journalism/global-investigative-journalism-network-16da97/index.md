#### Deadline

December 12, 2025

ICIJ is looking for a senior Backend developer to join their technology team, working closely with their fullstack engineers and system engineers, as well as a UX/UI designer. This is a fulltime position.

With the help of your teammates, you will be responsible for designing, building and shipping features for our self-hosted document search engine called Datashare. Datashare is an open source software which allows reporters to quickly index and search among millions of documents, regardless of their content types. The software was designed to be both used on a local computer and on a server with multi-tenancy. In the coming months, our team will roll out more features such as audio transcription, machine translation, NLP, structured data integration and a more reliable task manager to handle new complex data workflows.

This is a full time position that can be performed either remotely or be based in our office in Paris, France. As our tech team is primarily located in Europe, this position is expected to maintain a working schedule that is close to regular European office hours.
