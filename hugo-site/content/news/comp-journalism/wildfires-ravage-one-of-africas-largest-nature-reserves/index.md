**Late last month, fires engulfed Namibia’s most visited wildlife reserve – Etosha National Park. An analysis of satellite imagery by Bellingcat has found that more than a third of the park was affected, impacting crucial grazing lands for endangered species, including black rhinos, giraffes and elephants.**

Wildfires began on Sept. 22 and swept through the reserve and surrounding areas for five days before an emergency government meeting on Saturday,
[Sept. 27.](https://www.facebook.com/NamibianPresidency/posts/pfbid02siZHzHF3UocQEBZYXhyZtVnrsDb6kHiy4JPu7R1SAFR9XVe3s64vv31dQMFBgbuFl)
After days of extensive burning, the government

to the region the following day.

Optical satellite imagery from NASA shows an area of at least 6,000km² was impacted, including agricultural areas beyond the park’s northern border, in the time taken for the government to call an emergency meeting.

[local media,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u686tSsdv-0&t=66s)
residents and volunteers said the fire was impossible to extinguish without more support, including fire trucks and helicopters.

of the park had been scorched by the fire. Bellingcat’s analysis of NASA satellite imagery showed at least 7000km² – more than a third of the national park – was affected.

Investigations

As a vast area of
[savanna grassland](https://www.meft.gov.na/national-parks/etosha-national-park/217/)
, fires – often ignited by lightning – are a natural part of the park’s ecosystem, says
[Prof. Theo Wassenaar](https://fhnras.nust.na/prof-theo-wassenaar#:~:text=Research%20interest%3A,and%20the%20support%20of%20livelihoods.)
, a specialist in biodiversity conservation from Namibia University. However, the scale of this most recent fire is rare.

“Savanna without fires is not a savanna” says
[Prof. Wassenaar](https://fhnras.nust.na/prof-theo-wassenaar#:~:text=Research%20interest%3A,and%20the%20support%20of%20livelihoods.)
. But “this Etosha fire was notable because it was very large,” he says – “a gigafire (more than 1,000,000 ha)”.

The Namibian Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism did not respond to our request for comment on the time taken to deploy troops to fight the fire.

However, in a public release the Ministry said: “The wildfire crisis in Etosha National Park and surrounding areas poses a significant threat to Namibia’s biodiversity, local livelihood and critical infrastructure.

## **Origins of the fire**

In
[a post on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/tjitunga.ngurare/posts/pfbid02MLnE25Vrru5aCgJ35xRDvuccPkFYPMtQMGkXRtkJF4SpJwVeNaa7DhYQvGXErkNbl?comment_id=2212845539219534&_rdc=1&_rdr#)
, Prime Minister Tjitunga Elijah Ngurare claimed the fires “began on 22 September 2025 in the south-western part of the park due to suspected charcoal production activities on bordering commercial farms.”

NASA FIRMS data matches the Prime Minister’s statement, indicating the fire originated just beyond the park’s south-western borders. As seen below,
[NASA FIRMS](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/04/scorched-earth-using-nasa-fire-data-to-monitor-war-zones/)
employs a colour classification system to show how long ago an active fire was detected. The yellow square below indicates this latest Etosha wildfire was first detected at 15:25 on Sept, 22.

**NASA FIRMS data from Sept. 22 shows a single yellow square just beyond the park’s borders, marking the earliest fire event that day. Orange and red squares indicate more active fires detected later the same day. Source:*
[*NASA FIRMS*](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/map/)*
.

Further analysis of the yellow square’s location using satellite imagery confirms fire damage occurred on Sept.22, the first day of the event. Weather data from the same day, via
[Zoom.Earth](https://zoom.earth/maps/wind-speed/#view=-19.397366,14.667398,9.25z/place=-19.245556,14.741389/model=icon/date=2025-09-26,08:00,+2)
, also supports this, with the fire’s outward spread aligning with a north-easterly wind direction.

Google Earth imagery also confirmed the presence of a small village and several charcoal kilns near the location identified as the earliest active fire by NASA FIRMS. However, without an extensive ground investigation, the exact cause of the fire cannot be determined.

**Charcoal kilns, blackened earth, and small dark mounds suggest ongoing charcoal production near the yellow square location identified by NASA FIRMS. Source:*

.

The Ministry did not respond to Bellingcat’s request for comment as to why they suspect the fire began in this location.

## **Casualties of the Fire**

Within days of the fires engulfing large swathes of the park,
[an image of an injured elephant](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=10162347004694372&set=pcb.10162347005229372)
, badly burned, began circulating on social media.

In response to a flurry of commentators
[challenging the authenticity of the image](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPO6rvojTQX/)
, the Minister of Environment, Forestry and Tourism, Indileni Daniel,
[told reporters at a press conference](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1364617045014337)
they could not confirm the image had been taken within Etosha Park, nor could the elephant be confirmed as one of the casualties of the most recent fires. At that time, the only confirmed animal losses – identified by government helicopters monitoring the area – were nine antelopes, one elephant and one injured pangolin.

In an interview with a local news outlet,
[Network Media Hub](https://youtu.be/nuOPoqGJTFY?t=1014)
, the photographer Koos Reyneke described taking the photo of the injured elephant near a watering hole “just before Charl Marais Dam.” Bellingcat was able to geolocate the image to
[Ozonjuitji m’ Bari](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gHXaSkGPibGwxpmM8)
, a waterhole close to the Charl Marais Reservoir.

Additional matching features include the horizon line rising to the left, similar bush patterns, and the mud pool in the foreground, which is overflow water from the nearby waterhole.

statement that the photos,

[SunCalc](https://www.suncalc.org/#/-18.9767,15.5038,19/2025.09.28/11:47/100/1)
estimated the shadow length to be 42% of the animal’s height. By recreating the sun and shadow positions, SunCal calculated the photo was taken at 11:47 on Sept, 28.*

on Sept.29, stating, “All fires contained / mop-up and monitoring continues.” The Ministry says it will continue conducting aerial surveys by helicopter to assess the extent of the damage. NASA FIRMS continued to detect active fires in Etosha up until Oct. 5.
