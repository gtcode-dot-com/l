The Sentry is seeking an experienced and dynamic EU Senior Policy Advisor to lead the organization’s strategic engagement with the European Union and its Member States on a range of policy matters related to illicit finance, corruption, human rights, conflict, and related investigations conducted by The Sentry. This role will play an important part in The Sentry’s effort to support the EU in leading the global fight against corruption and illicit finance by providing information, analysis and policy recommendations.

The EU Senior Policy Advisor will engage with European policy makers in Brussels, including EU institutions and members states; in EU capitals with member state government officials; in program countries with EU delegations and embassy employees; and with the private sector, including EU banks and other private sector stakeholders that have the power to halt illicit financial flows, block transactions, and freeze assets. The role includes organizing in-person and online briefings, bilateral meetings, and roundtables; engaging in public-private partnerships related to our country programs and thematic priorities; and publishing policy papers including op-eds.

This position calls for a mission-driven, highly strategic critical thinker who thrives in a fast-paced environment, is versed in a range of policy options, and is skilled at strategic advocacy with a broad group of government, multilateral bodies, private entities, and civil society groups.
