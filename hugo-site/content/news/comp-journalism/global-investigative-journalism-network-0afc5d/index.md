#### Organization

Mongabay

#### Location

Remote

#### Deadline

Open until filled

The Fellowship Editor will primarily be responsible for establishing and managing Mongabay’s first Portuguese-language fellowship program, including overseeing the application process; selecting and onboarding fellows in coordination with other Mongabay staff; developing and delivering training content in Portuguese; working directly with fellows to publish on Mongabay’s Portuguese-language website; facilitating collaboration between fellows and Mongabay editors; and supporting Mongabay’s newsroom with copyediting and spot editing. The Fellowship Editor will manage and work with several fellows at any given time, and at least 6 per year.

A qualified candidate for this position should have editing experience, strong analytical skills, and the ability to discern what stories are important and of interest to readers. Knowledge and familiarity with environmental issues, experience with journalism training, and comfort working with writers whose primary language may not be Portuguese are strong positives.
