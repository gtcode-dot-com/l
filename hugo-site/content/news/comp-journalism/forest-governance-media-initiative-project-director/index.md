Internews is seeking to hire a Project Director to lead a new 3-year project which will leverage the power of media and civil society to contribute towards more sustainable and fair forest governance in Asia and Africa. The project, which is funded through the FCDO Forest Governance Markets and Climate (FGMC2) programme, will support journalists, media and civil society in Cameroon, Liberia, Ghana, Vietnam and Indonesia to enhance media coverage of forest governance issues, raise public awareness and influence decision makers to support more equitable and sustainable forest management.

The Project Director will serve as the prime focal point for the project, supervising all aspects of project implementation and ensuring quality control of project deliverables, financial and programme management, reporting, monitoring and supervision and evaluation. In addition to ensuring overall compliance with Internews’ policies and funder requirements, the Project Director will also supervise project staff, maintain strong relationships with local partners and ensure coordination between consortium partners across Asia, Africa and Europe by leading regular steering committee meetings. The Project Director will report to the EJN Senior Program Officer and will closely coordinate with the Earth Journalism Network (EJN) Programme team and relevant regional teams at Internews.
