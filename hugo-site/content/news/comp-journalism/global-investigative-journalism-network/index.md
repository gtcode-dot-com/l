#### Organization

Mnemonic

#### Location

Berlin, Germany or Remote

#### Deadline

January 8, 2026

Mnemonic works at the intersection of archiving of open source information and leveraging that preserved content as evidence, for accountability. Our legal work involves building digital evidence archives, litigation support, and open source investigations into international crimes and human rights violations.

Legal & Research is a cross-functional programme at Mnemonic: it fills an essential coordination role, aiming to connect the dots on research methods and activities across all Mnemonic programmes and ensure good compliance with open source research and evidence standards. More specifically, Mnemonic’s legal team endeavours to secure the evidentiary potential of the open source archives and support all Mnemonic programmes in their efforts to leverage the archived material to advance justice and accountability for serious harms including human rights violations and international crimes. Mnemonic legal contributes to legal projects or potential legal projects such as case-building work, requests for information, and any other activities involving legal systems or analysis.

As a Legal Advisor for Mnemonic you will provide technical legal support to all research teams and programmes: Syrian Archive, Yemeni Archive, Sudanese Archive, Ukrainian Archive, Rapid Response, and our Technical Team. Your input might include advice on legal interventions, detailed review of research outputs, feedback on the design and implementation of new research tools or methods, and more.

Our team is small but impactful, meaning this role entails both groundbreaking advancements in international legal practice and essential-but-mundane system maintenance responsibilities. You will help to brainstorm innovative ways of leveraging digital open source evidence for accountability, and you will also meticulously check all legal outputs for basic typos and formatting issues. You will be involved in building cases for creative and strategic impact – sometimes by formatting dozens of footnotes under tight deadlines. We are looking for a new team member who is fully on board for all that this working spectrum entails, and who recognises that these types of jobs can often involve more time on the daily grind than the cutting edge.
