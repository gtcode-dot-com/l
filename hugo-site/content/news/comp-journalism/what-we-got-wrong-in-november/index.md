At the end of every month,
*The Dispatch*
rounds up all the corrections or clarifications we issued that month and publishes them. You can read about
[our thinking behind this practice here](https://thedispatch.com/article/what-we-got-wrong-in-april/#comments)
, but the short version is this: We’re proud of our editorial standards, we know we won’t be perfect, and when we fall short, we want to own it—clearly and transparently.

Below are the corrections and clarifications we made in November. As always, our mistakes are rarely the fault of any one person, but the responsibility for what we publish rests with me. If you see something we missed, please email us at corrections@thedispatch.com.
