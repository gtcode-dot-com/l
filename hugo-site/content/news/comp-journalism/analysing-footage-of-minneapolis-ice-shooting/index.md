On Jan. 7 Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot and killed by a federal agent on Portland Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The incident was captured on several separate videos and spread rapidly on social media. The videos were soon accompanied by competing analysis and narratives as to what had happened.

Bellingcat looked at five videos filmed during the incident, including one apparently from the phone of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who shot and killed Good.

While each video alone provides valuable information, the five together provide a fuller picture of the situation as it unfolded.

## Synced Overview

One of the ways to visualise the full incident was by tracking the movements of the key players on an overview map, which Bellingcat did shortly after the incident on Jan. 7.

Using eyewitness
[video](https://bsky.app/profile/danielsuitor.com/post/3mbtzlfajm227)
shared by Daniel Suitor on Bluesky we tracked the movements of federal agents at the scene – including Ross as he moved around the street. The video also captured the position and movements of Good’s vehicle before, during and after the shots were fired.

## Close-Up View

[Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CJY5p0xz4&t=4s)
, filmed by a bystander and later shared by the Minnesota Reformer, shows a closer view of Ross’ movements in the moments immediately before the shooting.

In the video, Ross can be seen with his phone in his left hand filming Good before he pulls his gun out of its holster with his right hand. Roughly one second elapses before he fires the first round through Good’s front window. Two more shots follow.

VIDEO

A still from that same video captures Ross as he walks past in the seconds after the shooting. A camera app appears open on his phone.

## Agent’s Phone

On Jan. 9, a video filmed by Ross was
[published on X](https://x.com/AlphaNews/status/2009679932289626385)
by a conservative news outlet called Alpha News.

By syncing this video up with the other four available videos, it was possible to observe more of what occurred, including from Ross’ rough perspective. However, it is important to note that Ross was holding the phone slightly away from his body, so what appears in the video would be marginally different to what would have been his line of sight.

In the footage, Good can be seen backing up before veering to the right as Ross and the camera move to her left. It is not clear from this footage exactly how close the car came to Ross, as the cellphone points up and away as the vehicle moves forward. Someone can be heard saying “whoa” before gunshots are heard.

) – which some have suggested shows Ross being hit by the vehicle – does appear to show the vehicle pass close to the agent as he fires. However, the close-up video shared by the Minnesota Reformer (middle top and in full view
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CJY5p0xz4&t=4s)
) shows Ross moving out of the way and to the side of the vehicle as he fires.

Almost one week after the incident, protests have been held in
[Minneapolis](https://news.sky.com/story/thousands-march-against-renee-goods-killing-as-hundreds-of-protests-planned-across-us-13492955)
and
[other cities](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/us/ice-shooting-protests-minnesota.html)
in the US.

US President, Donald Trump, and Department of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, initially said that Good had tried to run over an ICE officer after blocking the road, labelling her a “domestic terrorist”. However, the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, said that version of events was “garbage” and disproven by the video footage.

On Monday January 12, Noem,
[told FOX News](https://news.sky.com/story/hundreds-more-officers-heading-to-minnesota-amid-nationwide-protests-over-ice-killing-of-mother-of-three-13493516)
that more ICE agents would be sent to Minnesota.
