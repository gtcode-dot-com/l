> **[A.] M.B.'s Right to Formal Education Past the Eighth Grade**

> We begin by recognizing that this issue is unique: whereas the relevant precedents guiding our consideration all involve the right of parents to the free exercise of their religion versus the interest of a state in establishing and enforcing educational standards, this case involves the right of a

> Focusing on subsections (a)(13) and (18) of the FCBR, the petitioner argues that M.B.'s continued placement with Amish foster parents will deprive him of his statutory right to attend school—specifically, high school—and his right of access to information about available educational options, thus mandating his removal from the foster parents' home. We disagree. The petitioner appears to view each and every provision of the FCBR as mandatory, i.e., one strike and you're out. However, our precedents make clear that with the exception of subsections (a)(1), (2), and (3), the provisions of the FCBR constitute an interwoven set of factors to be considered and weighed in making a determination of whether a foster child's placement is in his or her best interests….

> The petitioner next alleges that pursuant to the FCBR, M.B. has a right to medical care—care that he will not receive because the foster father testified that the Amish community does not have a doctor, that children are taken to the doctor only in situations where home health remedies are clearly inadequate, and that community members do not routinely vaccinate their children. We reject this claim both on legal and factual grounds.

> …, an allegation that the placement of a child will result in a deprivation of a right enumerated in subsections (a)(4) through (21) of the FCBR does not, in and of itself, mandate removal from the placement; rather, the facts and circumstances are to be considered and weighed by the circuit court together with all other facts and circumstances supporting, or not supporting, the placement.
>
> Second, the facts of this case simply do not support the petitioner's allegations that M.B. has been or will be denied medical care. The evidence of record shows that the foster parents have scrupulously abided by all of the DHS's requirements, taking M.B. for regular medical checkups, having him vaccinated, taking him to a specialist for treatment and a surgical procedure to correct

> for children who will not be attending public school….
>
> [T]he circuit court considered and weighed all of the evidence presented and concluded that placement with the foster parents would not result in the denial of M.B.'s right to medical care. Again, the court's findings of fact and conclusions of law are amply supported by the evidence of record, and we therefore will not disturb the court's ruling.
>
> **[C.] M.B.'s Placement With a White Family …**
>
> In his testimony, the foster father acknowledged that the foster parents had expressed a preference for White children but explained that they did so out of a concern that the Amish community might not accept children of another race, a concern which proved to be wholly unfounded. {The foster father testified that the community had been completely accepting of, and welcoming to, all four of the children.} The foster father further testified that if this ever changed, i.e., if the community became less accepting or welcoming as time went on, the family would move to another community. Finally, notwithstanding any initial hesitation they may have had, the fact is that the foster parents went ahead and welcomed four mixed-race children into their home, have adopted three of them, and hope to adopt M.B. as well.
>
> We reject any suggestion by the petitioner that the foster parents' initial stated preference for a White child should somehow disqualify them from providing a home for children of other races or ethnicities, or that they in any way have denied M.B. a safe and healthy environment. The evidence in this case is undisputed that the foster parents have provided M.B. and his sisters with what the special commissioner characterized as a "loving and spiritual" home….

Each of the other four Justices on the five-Justice court wrote separate concurrences. Justice
[Thomas Ewing's](https://www.courtswv.gov/sites/default/pubfilesmnt/2025-11/24-176-ewing-sep-p.pdf)
and Justice
[Haley Bunn's](https://www.courtswv.gov/sites/default/pubfilesmnt/2025-11/24-176-bunn-sep-p.pdf)
concurrences stressed the importance of keeping the child with (to quote Justice Bunn) "the only family he has ever known." Senior Justice
[John Hutchison's](https://www.courtswv.gov/sites/default/pubfilesmnt/2025-11/24-176-hutchison-sep-p.pdf)
concurrence likewise took a similar approach: "There was no showing by anyone establishing that it was in M.B.'s best interest to remove him from his foster home or that any of the other statutory requirements … were present."

Wyclif Farquharson represents the state and Aimee N. Goddard (Legal Aid of West Virginia) represents intervenors.
