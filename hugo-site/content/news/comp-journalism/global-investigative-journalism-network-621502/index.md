Corporate Watch

#### Location

#### Deadline

February 1, 2026

Corporate Watch (CW) is a research and training organisation that helps people challenge corporate power. We are a small workers’ cooperative which has produced strategic “information for action” to help grassroots campaigns win victories since 1996. We aim to model the world we would like to see: we take no corporate funding, earn a flat rate of pay, and make decisions by consensus.

We investigate exploitative bosses, landlords and property developers, companies profiting from prisons, deportation flights, animal exploitation and more, as well as the mega-corporations devastating our planet and communities – and the wider systems of power and profit they work within. We provide dedicated research and training for grassroots campaigners.
