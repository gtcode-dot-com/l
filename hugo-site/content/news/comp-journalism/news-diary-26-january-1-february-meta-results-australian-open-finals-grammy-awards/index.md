Results from tech giants Meta, Apple, Samsung and Microsoft are set to be released this week, indicating the current status of the global technology sector.

In sporting news, the men’s and women’s final of the Australian Open will be held on Friday and Saturday respectively.

And the spotlight shifts to music on Sunday as the Grammys celebrate the biggest achievements of the past year.

Meanwhile, one story set to dominate headlines during the week is Keir Starmer’s anticipated travel to China, which comes after the government’s approval of the country’s mega-embassy in London and with the prime minister’s approach to international security under intense scrutiny. Downing Street hasn’t announced dates yet, but reporting suggests Starmer is expected in Beijing and Shanghai from 29-31 January. A trip to Japan is expected to follow over the weekend.
