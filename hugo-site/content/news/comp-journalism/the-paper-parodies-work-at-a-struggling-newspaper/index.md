Peacock attempted to recapture the magic of
*The Office*
in
[*The Paper*](https://www.peacocktv.com/stream-tv/the-paper)
, a spin-off series set at a local newspaper. The mockumentary follows the travails of the
*Toledo Truth Teller*
, a once-thriving paper that now shares an office and staff with a toilet paper company. Both are owned by the same paper-products firm. An idealistic new editor in chief, Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), has arrived to turn the newspaper from a clickbait mill into a proper journalistic outlet.

Current and former reporters will bitterly enjoy
*The Paper*
's depiction of a struggling newsroom. I had a strong moment of
*déjà vu*
during a scene where Sampson tours the empty floors of the old news building. (On my first day at a regional newspaper, the guy who gave me a tour said there'd been a round of layoffs the day before and he'd just taken a buyout.)

*The Paper*
apes the format of
*The Office*
, but while
*The Office*
focused on employees in purgatorial jobs that emphatically didn't matter, the reporters of the
*Truth Teller*
believe their work means something.

*The Paper*
is at its best contrasting many journalists' self-important self-image as a pillar of democracy with what journalism often constitutes in practice: asking a sanitation worker what substance caused a giant sewer clog. But much of the first season misses the sweet spot for humor, and only a couple of characters consistently generate laughs. Good reporters remember to grab the audience's attention from the start.
