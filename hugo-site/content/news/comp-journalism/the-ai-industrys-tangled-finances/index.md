Circular financing is not particularly novel. “The idea of a vendor partially financing its customers’ purchases is nothing spectacular—that’s very common, that’s as old as we’ve had commerce,” Jay Goldberg, an equity analyst at Seaport Research Partners, told
**TMD**
. Circular financing is particularly useful in high-capital-expenditure industries like AI, where nascent companies must deploy substantial funds to scale their operations.

“What Nvidia is investing in are the up-and-comers, enabling people in a very capital-intensive business to actually have a chance to compete in the business, because if they had no capital, it would be very difficult,” Wes Cummins, chairman and CEO of Applied Digital, an AI data center builder and operator, told
**TMD**
.

Within the AI industry, businesses fall into several main categories, all of which rely on each other to keep the technological supply chain running. At the bottom of the pyramid are companies like Nvidia and AMD that manufacture the hardware—such as Nvidia’s powerful
[GPU chips](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/)
—that provide the raw computational power needed to train and run AI models. Above them are the
[cloud computing providers](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/hyperscale)
—services like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure—that make that computational power accessible to AI developers and end users, and newer GPU-rental firms, like CoreWeave, that buy chips in bulk and rent out access to them. Above that are the foundational AI
[models](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/)
themselves—systems like OpenAI’s GPT-5 or Anthropic’s Claude models—that are trained on and operate using all of the computational power below them. And at the very top are the applications that regular people and businesses actually use—from AI chatbots to workplace software.

Almost every major company in this stack uses some form of circular financing—and though it’s become normalized, some Wall Street investors and Silicon Valley executives worry these deals appear to inflate demand, giving businesses—and investors—a false sense of economic optimism. “I don’t think it’s run-of-the-mill,” Martin Schmalz, a professor of finance at the University of Oxford, told
**TMD**
when asked about the extent of circular financing present in today’s AI industry. “I think there are reasons to be concerned about it.”

During the
[dot-com bubble](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/career-map/sell-side/capital-markets/dotcom-bubble/)
, hardware vendors like Cisco and Lucent financed their own customers’ purchases to fuel explosive growth, only to see those customers default on their loans when the boom went bust. Back then, internet companies invested heavily based on the assumption that consumer adoption of the internet would be quick and monetizable—an eerily similar bet to those being made by today’s AI firms.

“These companies are investing a huge amount, and they don’t really have a way of recouping it,” Daron Acemoglu, a professor of economics at MIT and the recipient of last year’s Nobel Prize in Economics, told
**TMD**
.

Acemoglu thinks the turn to circular financing could signal that the AI industry is overplaying its hand and betting billions of dollars on an outcome that is far from certain. “Hype is only going to get you so far, and at that point you have to get into creative ways of financing, and that’s what we’ve seen with previous bubbles as well,” Acemoglu said. “It’s worrying because circular financing and some of these other deals are symptoms of the amount of investment ongoing in the industry, far exceeding what can be supported in a financial market.”

But while comparisons to the dot-com crash are legion, there are meaningful
[distinctions](https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/insights/market-insights/market-updates/on-the-minds-of-investors/does-circularity-in-ai-deals-warn-of-a-bubble/)
. Most of today’s AI companies are profitable and fund investments using existing cash flow—neither of which was true in the dot-com era. And whereas early internet infrastructure was built on the expectation of demand, the demand for AI is already here. Data center
[vacancy rates](https://www.cbre.com/insights/reports/north-america-data-center-trends-h1-2025)
are extremely low, and new data centers are being
[rapidly built](https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/morning/inside-americas-ai-infrastructure-arms-race/)
across the country—a signal that there is legitimate demand to meet growing investment. “These things have a massive amount of users,” Cummins said. “You turn it on, and it’s completely utilized. That’s very different than what we saw [during the dot-com bubble].”

Still, the widespread uncertainty surrounding almost every aspect of the technology, its future development, and its use cases, makes analyzing the current boom challenging. Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic are not just betting on their AI models continuing to dramatically improve in performance, but also on their best real-world applications being identified, widely adopted, and quickly monetized.

Even if the best-case scenario is realized, it’s hard to know how many of today’s AI firms would be part of that eventual success. Different AI models, chip manufacturers, and cloud providers could excel in tandem in a future AI-integrated economy—but the industry could also consolidate into one or two dominant horizontally integrated firms, running the best cloud systems and models, with little space for competition.

Today’s professional and amateur AI power users play around with all the models, but usually have one preferred model for the vast majority of their work. At the moment, this changes quickly, and it’s trivially easy to migrate between models. On November 18, Google
[released](https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/)
its Gemini 3 model, widely viewed as the most capable on the market—only for Anthropic to
[release](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5)
Claude Opus 4.5 six days later and steal its crown.

But if one of these models emerges as vastly superior to the others and holds its lead, demand for inferior competitors could collapse, potentially wiping out billions of dollars in investment by those competitors.

That second scenario—that only one or two of these firms may win the AI arms race—is of particular concern to some market observers, who worry that AI companies may be investing out of fear of falling behind rather than with a positive, achievable business model. “If I’m one of these players, I’m going all in if it’s an all-or-nothing bet,” Michael Ewens, a professor of finance at Columbia University, told
**TMD**
. “If someone’s going to give me cheap capital, and there’s only gonna be [one or two] winners, I’m gonna do everything I can to become that winner.”

That uncertainty may be driving more aggressive investment. “What we’re seeing right now is this early gold rush mentality,” Goldberg said. “Lots of companies think that they need to rush in to grab territory now and secure their future, and that’s expensive.”

Another point of concern is that some AI companies are now turning to debt to finance their ambitious growth. Elon Musk’s xAI has been
[notable](https://www.reuters.com/business/musks-xai-raise-up-12-billion-debt-ai-expansion-wsj-reports-2025-07-22/)
for this, raising billions in debt to fund its aggressive expansion. “Once you move into the debt phase of things, it gets much more dangerous,” Goldberg said. “When things turn down—and they will turn down—debt amplifies the pain on the downside, and I think that’s where we’re starting to get into trouble.”

Ewens agreed. “The emergence of debt does make you worried,” he said. “I wasn’t worried six months ago—now I have a little more concern.”

Ultimately, the outcome of the AI investment boom remains deeply uncertain. “All of this may pay out—it may turn out that capabilities will advance extremely fast, and then they will find a way of monetizing them in such spectacular ways that billions of dollars will be repaid quickly,” Acemoglu said. “But it looks a little unlikely to me.”

Whatever becomes of the AI boom, the consequences will likely extend far beyond tech company balance sheets simply because of the concentration of AI companies in investment portfolios. “For a lot of people, this sounds very remote: ‘I don’t work in tech, I don’t actually care about this,’” Goldberg said. “But it’s going to be felt way beyond tech.”
