## About This Research

The Chiral Narrative Synthesis (CNS) project explores novel approaches to AI-powered narrative generation through dialectical reasoning frameworks. The research combines theoretical foundations from philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive science with practical implementations using large language models.

For technical implementation details, see the [CNS repositories](/repos/) including `dspex`, `pipeline_ex`, and related Elixir/BEAM packages.
