## Re: Complaint Against Audrey L.E. Stanley, Esq. — Misconduct During Tenure as Public Defender

Dear Disciplinary Counsel:

I am filing this complaint against **Audrey L.E. Stanley**, a member of the Hawai'i State Bar currently serving as a Per Diem District Judge for the First Circuit (Oahu). This complaint concerns her conduct during her prior tenure as a **Deputy Public Defender** with the Office of the Public Defender, State of Hawai'i, when she served as my assigned counsel.

This complaint is filed at the direction of the **Commission on Judicial Conduct**, which acknowledged receipt of this information in a letter dated **June 26, 2025** (signed by Vice Chair Doris M. Ching), and advised that complaints against attorneys for conduct occurring in their capacity as attorneys are handled by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. A copy of that letter is attached as **Exhibit A**.

## I. Background and Attorney-Client Relationship

In or around **late 2015**, Audrey L.E. Stanley was assigned as my public defender in a criminal matter in the First Circuit. The case was subsequently **expunged**; the case number is not immediately available due to the expungement but may be recoverable through court records. The indictment in the case was filed on **February 25, 2016** (the day of the Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational), and I was contacted by a sheriff the following day.

At all relevant times, Ms. Stanley owed me the duties of competent representation, loyalty, communication, and zealous advocacy as my attorney under the Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct.

---

## II. Statement of Facts

### A. Disclosure of Murder Threat

In **late November 2015**, during the course of my representation, I informed Ms. Stanley that **Eugene and Rita Hartmann** had issued what I understood to be a credible, conspired, and coordinated **threat against my life**. The Hartmanns are the parents of Pete Johnson's wife; Pete Johnson is the brother of musician Jack Johnson, placing the Hartmanns within the Johnson family circle on the North Shore of Oahu.

The threat was made in the context of my investigation into criminal conduct by associates of the Hartmanns and the broader North Shore social network. I reported this threat to Ms. Stanley in her capacity as my attorney, seeking her counsel and expecting that she would take appropriate action to protect my safety and my legal interests.

### B. Failure to Act on Threat Information

Rather than taking any steps to address the threat — such as reporting it to law enforcement, seeking protective orders, raising it with the court, or incorporating it into my defense strategy — Ms. Stanley **dismissed and downplayed** the murder threat. She conveyed that it was not a significant matter.

### C. Relaying of Coercive Offer

Instead of advocating for my safety, Ms. Stanley **relayed an offer** to the effect that charges would be "dropped" if I **"left the state."** This offer did not originate from my defense strategy or my instructions. It was communicated to me by Ms. Stanley as a proposed resolution.

This conduct is consistent with Ms. Stanley acting as a **conduit for pressure from parties adverse to my interests** — specifically, the network connected to the Hartmanns and the Johnson family circle — rather than as my zealous advocate. A public defender relaying a coercive ultimatum to her own client to abandon his home and community under threat of continued prosecution represents a fundamental betrayal of the attorney-client relationship.

---

## III. Rules of Professional Conduct Violated

The conduct described above implicates the following provisions of the **Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct**:

**Rule 1.1 — Competence:** A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Failing to address a credible murder threat against a client, and failing to incorporate that information into the defense strategy, falls below the standard of competent representation.

**Rule 1.3 — Diligence:** A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client. Dismissing a murder threat rather than investigating it or taking protective action is a failure of diligence.

**Rule 1.4 — Communication:** A lawyer shall reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to be pursued. Relaying a coercive offer to leave the state — without context, without recommendation against it, and without apparent regard for the client's interests — fails to meet this standard.

**Rule 1.7 — Conflict of Interest:** A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. Ms. Stanley's conduct — dismissing a credible threat and relaying a coercive offer originating from parties adverse to her client — is consistent with deference to a network she could not afford to antagonize. At the time of these events, Ms. Stanley was a Deputy Public Defender regularly appearing before **Per Diem Judge Wilson M.N. Loo** in the First Circuit. Judge Loo's wife, **Janice Luke Loo**, simultaneously served as a Commissioner on the **Hawai'i Supreme Court Commission on Judicial Conduct** — the body that regulates judicial ethics and, by extension, the professional environment in which public defenders operate. The Hartmann family (the source of the threat against me) is connected to the Jack Johnson family circle, which in turn intersects with the Luke family's institutional interests through the **Luke Center for Public Service at Punahou School** and the **Kōkua Hawaiʻi Foundation**. Ms. Stanley's deference to the interests of this network, rather than zealous advocacy for her client, is consistent with a practitioner navigating a power structure in which the same families influence judicial appointments, ethical oversight, and philanthropic institutions. If Ms. Stanley was acting under such influence, this constitutes a conflict that should have been disclosed and that likely required withdrawal from the representation.

**Rule 8.4 — Misconduct:** It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice. Relaying a coercive offer that conditions the dropping of charges on a defendant's departure from the state — particularly when that offer appears to originate from parties connected to the threat against the defendant — is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.

## IV. Relevance of Current Judicial Role

While this complaint concerns Ms. Stanley's conduct as an attorney, I note for the record that she currently serves as a **Per Diem District Judge for the First Circuit (Oahu)** — the same circuit where these events occurred. The Commission on Judicial Conduct has confirmed it does not have jurisdiction over conduct occurring in an attorney capacity, even for sitting judges (see Exhibit A). However, the conduct described herein is directly relevant to Ms. Stanley's **fitness and character** as an officer of the court now exercising judicial authority.

---

## V. Prior Reporting and Institutional Responses

This matter has been documented in the following contexts:

1. **Commission on Judicial Conduct** — Information regarding Ms. Stanley's conduct was submitted by letter dated **May 22, 2025** (Ref: 1DSS-22-0001008). The Commission responded on **June 26, 2025**, declining jurisdiction and referring the matter to ODC. (Exhibit A)

2. **Federal Criminal Complaint** — A comprehensive federal criminal complaint was filed with the FBI on **July 12, 2025**, documenting a broader pattern of institutional misconduct, of which Ms. Stanley's conduct forms one component.

3. **Public Record** — The allegations are documented on the public record website **GTCode.com** in the investigative series "Oahu Underground," including a detailed timeline of institutional failures.

## VII. Request

I respectfully request that the Office of Disciplinary Counsel:

1. **Investigate** the conduct of Audrey L.E. Stanley as described herein;
2. **Determine** whether her actions violated the Hawai'i Rules of Professional Conduct;
3. **Take appropriate disciplinary action** if violations are substantiated; and
