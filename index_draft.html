            <h3>⚠️ Content Warning</h3>
            <p>This site documents serious allegations of institutional abuse, judicial misconduct, violence, and systematic coverups. Content includes descriptions of childhood trauma, sexual violence, drug crimes, and institutional betrayal that may be disturbing to some readers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Purpose of This Site</h2>
            <p>This website serves as a <strong>permanent public record</strong> of alleged institutional failures, criminal activity, and systematic coverups in Hawai'i spanning multiple decades. After exhausting traditional legal remedies and reporting channels, this documentation represents a last resort to preserve the truth and hold powerful institutions accountable.</p>
            
            <div class="fact-box">
                <h4>Key Allegation</h4>
                <p>Hawai'i Judge Wilson Loo allegedly committed judicial misconduct by influencing witness testimony through non-verbal cues during a legal proceeding, then aggressively silencing objections to his actions. This occurred in an audio-only recorded hearing, making the visual misconduct nearly impossible to prove through official records.</p>

                <h4>The Spencer Klein Network: How Celebrity Stalking Became State Surveillance</h4>
                <p>What began as escaping stalking in Hawaii Kai led directly into a sophisticated surveillance network connected to Jack Johnson's circle, military/intelligence assets, and tech companies. The August 2015 Coffee Gallery incident where strangers mentioned "Spencer Klein" was the trigger point for decades of systematic targeting.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Intelligence Community Targeting</h3>

                <p>Google's use of Christopher D's brother Douglas's suicide to mock and harass the author demonstrates the systematic psychological warfare tactics employed. This wasn't random targeting - it was calculated use of personal tragedy to inflict maximum psychological damage.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p>This is not about one person's grievances. This is about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Institutional Accountability:</strong> When courts and police protect each other instead of serving justice</li>
                <li><strong>Victim Silencing:</strong> How powerful systems discredit and destroy those who speak truth</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic Corruption:</strong> The breakdown of checks and balances designed to prevent abuse</li>
                <li><strong>Future Prevention:</strong> Creating a public record so others can recognize these patterns</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Every institution that has failed to act appropriately has contributed to a system where powerful people can abuse vulnerable individuals with impunity. This documentation serves as evidence of that failure and a call for reform.</p>
