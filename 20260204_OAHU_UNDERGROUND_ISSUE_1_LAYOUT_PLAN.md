Agreed—freeze v2.

You’re right on both points:

* Keeping **“alleged”** in the teaser is *less* assertive than “a decisive act occurred,” and it cleanly signals “claimed, not proved.” The “no allegation” note is about *reader payload* (no names, no specifics, no conclusion), which remains true.
* **“Minimum”** is doing precision work that the alternates would dilute; the disclaimer line underneath already neutralizes “demand” tone.

## Issue 1 layout plan (so you can start building pages immediately)

### 0) Front matter (2–3 pages)

* **Masthead + mission** (one tight paragraph)
* **Series promise** (your three-part narrative engine, one graphic if you want)
* **Corrections & Challenges** placeholder (even if empty in Issue 1, set the ritual)

### 1) Prologue teaser (1 page)

* Your fragment + thesis line + “return in Issue 4 / first, the map”

### 2) Cold open feature (4–6 pages)

**1956 Damon Tract → 1960 bank founding myth**
Aim for: scene, then context, then pivot to why networks matter (without moralizing).

### 3) The Map (main body) (8–12 pages)

Organize as “three pillars + the joint”:

1. **Bank / land core** (entities + what they do)
2. **Civic legitimacy layer** (boards, foundations, schools, hospitals)
3. **Judicial proximity layer** (disclosures + roles)
4. **The joint**: marriage + oversight ecosystem adjacency (stated as structure)

### 4) Evidence Locker (2 pages)

* Reproduce the **specific Wilson Loo financial disclosure** you’re using.
* Annotation style: numbered callouts that correspond to **Network Map node IDs** (this is key—lets the reader cross-walk documents to the map).

### 5) Network Map (center spread)

* Same base map you’ll reuse.
* Highlight only the nodes introduced in Issue 1.
* Add a legend that will remain constant across issues (node types: bank / real estate / nonprofit / education / judiciary / oversight / media).

### 6) Verify / Cannot Verify (1 page)

Issue 1 should be almost entirely “verify.” That’s the point.

### 7) Silence Index (1 page)

Even if you haven’t contacted anyone yet for Issue 1, run the table with:

* “No outreach conducted for Issue 1 (records-only issue).”
  This prevents later claims you “started outreach only when accused.”

### 8) Next Records to Pull (1 page)

End with 3–5 concrete pulls that tee up Issue 2 cleanly:

* CJC rules (90-day provision) doc ID
* per diem judge guidance / admin rules on recording
* court recording policy memos (if any)
* appellate opinions list (Lockey/Rego/Noga) with docket IDs

## Two production decisions to make now (no extra research needed)

1. **Node ID system:** pick a stable scheme now (e.g., B1 bank, J1 judge, O1 oversight, P1 philanthropy). You’ll thank yourself in Issue 4/5.
2. **Annotation voice:** decide whether Evidence Locker notes are in:

   * neutral archivist voice (“This line discloses…”) or
   * light analytical voice (“This creates potential recusal surface area…”)

Given your bible, I’d keep Evidence Locker **archivist** and put analysis in body text.

If you paste (a) the exact disclosure PDF you’re using and (b) your draft Network Map node list, I’ll turn it into a **page-by-page outline with section headers and callout numbering** that matches your recurring schema.
