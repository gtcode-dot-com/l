# The Loo/Luke network: A powerful family alliance spanning Hawaii's banking, real estate, and civic institutions

The marriage of Judge Wilson M.N. Loo to Janice Luke Loo created one of Hawaii's most interconnected family networks—uniting judicial influence with the founding family of Hawaii National Bank. This network exercises power not primarily through political donations but through an extensive web of board positions spanning banking, federal institutions, philanthropy, education, and the judiciary itself. Wilson Loo's financial disclosures reveal holdings exceeding **$2 million** in Luke family enterprises, while his position on the Hawaii Supreme Court's Judicial Conduct Commission places him at the center of judicial oversight—a striking concentration of influence.

## Origins of the alliance: The Luke family empire

**K.J. (Kan Jung) Luke** (1914-2000) built the family's fortune from humble beginnings in North Kohala, Big Island, where his great-grandfather had immigrated from Guangdong, China in 1875. After becoming the first Chinese-American to earn Harvard Business School's Alumni Achievement Award (MBA 1938), K.J. Luke executed the deal that would define the family's wealth.

In **March 1956**, K.J. Luke and **Mrs. Lillian Tom Loo**—a pre-existing Loo family connection predating Wilson's marriage—purchased the **233-acre Damon Tract** near Honolulu airport for $4.5 million with just a **$100,000 down payment**. The purchase sparked public outcry, with critics claiming Luke "stole" the tract from the Hawaiian Aeronautics Commission. Within months, the City Planning Commission rezoned the area for commercial use, and Luke and Loo sold 25 acres for $1.65 million—recovering 75% of their down payment in a single transaction. The Territory of Hawaii subsequently condemned 67 acres for airport expansion at $3.5-5 million. This tract became the **Airport Industrial Park**, generating wealth that still flows through K.J.L. Associates and K.J.L., Inc. today.

K.J. Luke founded **Hawaii National Bank** on September 19, 1960, in Honolulu's Chinatown with partner **Clarence T.C. Ching**. The bank attracted **$6.25 million in first-day deposits**—a national record—and remains the only federally chartered national bank in Hawaii.

## Wilson Loo's financial entanglements with Luke enterprises

Judge Wilson M.N. Loo's 2021 Hawaii State Ethics Commission disclosure reveals substantial ownership interests in Luke family businesses acquired through his marriage to Janice Luke Loo:

| Entity | Interest | Value |
|--------|----------|-------|
| K.J.L. Associates | Limited Partner (through wife) | >$1,000,000 |
| K.J.L., Inc. | 20,885 shares common & preferred | Not disclosed |
| Hawaii National Bancshares | 16 shares (personal) + 52 shares (spouse trust) | Not disclosed |
| Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd. | 2 shares total (personal + spouse trust) | Not disclosed |
| Real property holdings | 4 properties (96816, 96822, 96826, 96813) | >$1,000,000 |

These holdings create a direct financial link between the per diem judge and Hawaii's commercial banking and real estate sectors. **K.J.L. Associates** owns industrial and commercial properties including airport-area land originally from the 1956 Damon Tract acquisition, while **Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd.** (established 1959) manages the family's property portfolio from 45 N. King Street, Suite 600—the same address as Warren Luke's registered agent listing.

## Political donations reveal banking industry alignment

Federal Election Commission records show **Warren K.K. Luke** directing political contributions primarily toward banking industry interests and Republican candidates—notably bypassing Hawaii's Democratic congressional delegation:

| Donor | Recipient | Amount | Date |
|-------|-----------|--------|------|
| Warren K.K. Luke | American Bankers Association PAC | $2,500 | April 2009 |
| Warren K.K. Luke | American Bankers Association PAC | $1,000 | January 2009 |
| Warren K.K. Luke | McConnell Senate Committee '14 | $1,100 | October 2009 |
| Warren K.K. Luke | Elizabeth Dole Committee | $1,000 | January 2007 |
| Carolyn Luke (spouse) | American Bankers Association PAC | $500 | January 2009 |

**No federal political donations were identified** for Wilson Loo or Janice Luke Loo. Hawaii National Bank notably lacks a corporate PAC, unlike competitors Bank of Hawaii and First Hawaiian Bank. The family's influence operates instead through institutional positions rather than direct political giving.

Warren K.K. Luke's board memberships constitute an extraordinary concentration of influence across financial regulation, international policy, and civic institutions:

## The judicial network: Wilson Loo's dual position

Wilson Loo occupies a remarkable position as both a **Per Diem District Judge** (First Circuit, since 1995) and a **Commissioner on the Hawaii Supreme Court's Judicial Conduct Commission**—the body that investigates allegations against judges. This dual role raises questions about judicial oversight given his family's extensive business interests.

**Loo's career trajectory:**
- **Law Clerk** to Chief U.S. District Judge Harold M. Fong (1982-1983)
- **Deputy Prosecuting Attorney**, City and County of Honolulu (1980-1984), during Charles Marsland's aggressive campaign against Hawaii organized crime
- **Private practice** specializing in commercial law and mediation
- **Per Diem Judge** since 1995, appearing on First Circuit rosters through present
- **International Arbitrator**, American Arbitration Association Panel (since 1990)

The Fong clerkship connection is noteworthy: current Hawaii Supreme Court **Chief Justice Mark Recktenwald** also clerked for Judge Fong, suggesting a judicial network through shared mentorship.

**Bar admissions** include Hawaii, U.S. District Court (Hawaii), U.S. Court of Appeals (9th Circuit), High Court of Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the U.S. Supreme Court.

## Board interlocks connecting Hawaii's elite families

The Loo/Luke network intersects with other powerful Hawaii families through overlapping board positions:

**REHAB Hospital of the Pacific Foundation** connects the Lukes to prominent families:
- Janice Luke Loo — Vice Chair (33+ years of involvement since 1990)
- Bryan Luke — Director (2014-present)
- Stanford Carr — Director/Treasurer
- Ronald Wo and Buzz Wo — Directors (Wo family furniture fortune)

- Janice Luke Loo serves on the **Wo International Center** advisory board at Punahou School
- Both Wo and Luke families share Punahou School, Dr. Sun Yat-sen Hawaii Foundation, and REHAB Hospital board seats

## The Punahou and Harvard networks

The family's social capital flows through Hawaii's most elite educational institutions:

**Punahou School** (Hawaii's most prestigious private school):
- **Warren Luke '62** — Trustee (1988-2020), Board Chair (2008-2009), Trustee Emeritus
- **Loretta Luke Yajima '64** — Alumna
- **Bryan Luke '93** — Alumnus

- Warren Luke (MBA 1970)
- Catherine Luke (MBA 2000)
- Kevin Luke (MBA 2002)
- Bryan Luke (MBA 2006)

The family supports the **Luke Family Fellowship Fund** and **Harvard Center Shanghai**, extending influence into U.S.-China business and academic exchange networks.

## Third generation: Succession and continuity

**Bryan Luke** assumed the presidency of Hawaii National Bank in 2019, continuing the family dynasty. His board positions mirror his father's pattern of banking industry and civic engagement:
- American Bankers Association
- Hawaii Bankers Association
- Western Independent Bankers (Past Chairman)
- Hawaii Community Reinvestment Corporation
- Pacific and Asian Affairs Council
- REHAB Hospital of the Pacific

**Loretta Luke Yajima** (1946-2021), Warren's sister, founded the **Hawaii Children's Discovery Center** in 1989, building it from 5,000 to 38,000 square feet through a $15 million capital campaign. She served as unpaid CEO for 30+ years and consulted on children's museums in Beijing and Inner Mongolia—earning the title "Rainbow Bridge" between Hawaii and China.

## International connections: Hong Kong, China, and the Pacific Rim

The Luke family maintains significant Asia-Pacific ties reflecting their Chinese heritage and banking interests:

- **Pacific Basin Economic Council** (Hong Kong headquarters) — Warren Luke as Chair Emeritus connects to Asia-Pacific business leadership
- **Sun Yat-sen Hawaii Foundation** — Warren Luke as Chairman honors the revolutionary's Hawaii schooling
- **Harvard Center Shanghai** — Family financial support
- **China children's museum consulting** — Loretta Yajima's work in Beijing and Inner Mongolia

Wilson Loo's background mentions connections to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, though specific relationships were not verified in public records. His admission to the High Court of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (1985) suggests historical engagement with Pacific Island legal matters.

## Conclusion: A study in elite network consolidation

The Loo/Luke network exemplifies how Hawaii's elite families consolidate power through strategic marriage, shared board positions, and institutional leadership rather than direct political contributions. Wilson Loo's financial disclosure reveals a judge with over **$2 million** in holdings tied to his wife's family enterprises—while simultaneously serving on the commission that disciplines other judges. Warren Luke's **nine years on the Federal Reserve Bank board** and leadership of multiple national organizations placed a Hawaii community banker at the center of financial policy-making. The family's Punahou-Harvard educational pipeline, combined with control of Hawaii's only federally chartered national bank and significant commercial real estate holdings from the 1956 Damon Tract acquisition, creates a self-reinforcing structure of influence spanning banking, land, philanthropy, education, and the judiciary.

The network's philanthropy—over **$6.3 million in Takitani Foundation scholarships** and major gifts to UH and Punahou—generates community goodwill while board positions on REHAB Hospital, the American Red Cross, and United Way provide civic legitimacy. Yet the absence of political donations to Hawaii's Democratic congressional delegation, combined with Warren Luke's Republican giving pattern, suggests the family operates outside conventional political alignments, preferring institutional influence to electoral politics.

What began with K.J. Luke's remarkable 1956 real estate transaction—turning $100,000 into the Airport Industrial Park—has evolved into an interlocking directorate touching nearly every significant institution in Hawaii's civic, commercial, and judicial landscape.
