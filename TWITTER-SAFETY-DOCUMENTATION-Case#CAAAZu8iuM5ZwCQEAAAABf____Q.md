For the record, I've informed @X of my intention to commit suicide in protest of broad corruption and criminal coverups.

re: Reference Case#CAAAZu8iuM5ZwCQEAAAABf____Q  

I am planning on committing suicide in protest of the corruption related to the reported criminal incidents and coverups.

Be aware that my suicide is in protest both of the corruption enacted by Wilson Loo and redacted Kindle, but also in protest of 
@google
 and 
@x
 malice against me. 

Your silence is your corruption.

 this time, I don't want any contact. I'm content to let the perpetrators cover up their crimes by discrediting a dead man.
