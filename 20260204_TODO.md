Based on the triad report and everything in the file, here's what's actionable:

**Complaints you can file now:**

- **ODC complaint against Vincent Kanemoto** — the alleged mock-pistol jury intimidation ("There was no gun. But what if there was? Convict him.") is attorney misconduct, not just prosecutorial overreach. Same ODC office, same framework. Do you have the case name/number and approximate date for that incident, and were you present or is this from witnesses?

- **ODC complaint against Young Kwak** — alleged perjury to a grand jury and "state-sanctioned grand theft." Same question on specifics and your direct knowledge versus witness accounts.

**Records requests (UIPA) you can file now:**

- **CJC annual reports for the full Janice Luke Loo tenure (2001-2022)** — 21 years of complaint statistics, dismissal rates, and commissioner rosters. The publicly available one only goes to FY 2020-21. The earlier ones may reveal patterns in how complaints were handled during her reign.

- **HPD incident reports** related to your complaints about the Hartmanns — if HPD refused to investigate, there should still be a record that a report was taken or declined. That paper trail supports the FBI complaint.

- **Stanley's case assignment records** from the Public Defender's office — which cases she was assigned during the relevant period. The expunged case itself may be sealed, but administrative assignment records may not be.

**Documentation you should prepare:**

- **A master exhibit binder** — every piece of primary source correspondence in chronological order: your complaints, their responses, the website discrepancy screenshots, the correction. Right now this evidence is scattered across emails and screenshots. A single organized package makes everything easier for any body reviewing it.

Which of these do you want to start with?
