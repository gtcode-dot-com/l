Re: Per Diem Judge Audrey L.E. Stanley 

Dear Mr. Lowndes: 

The Commission on Judicial Conduct has received and carefully reviewed your email messages dates May 18 and 22, 2025. 

The purpose of this Commission is to review allegations of misconduct or disability on the part of Hawai'i state court judges. Our review is limited to determining whether a Hawai'i state court judge violated the Hawai'i Revised Code of Judicial Conduct. 

As to your concerns that Wilson M.N. Loo was still listed as an active per diem judge on the Judiciary's webpage, the Judiciary's webmaster was notified and has corrected this matter. 

The Commission does not have jurisdiction to consider complaints against attorneys, even though Ms. Stanley may also be a per diem judge, if the conduct complained of occurred in her capacity as an attorney practicing law and not in her capacity as a per diem judge. 

This matter is closed. Complaints against attorneys are handled by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 201 Merchant Street, #1600, Honolulu, Hawai'i, 96813, telephone number (808) 521-4591. 

Lastly, any further submissions that are not within the Commission's jurisdiction will be filed without a response to you. 

Very truly yours, 

/S/ Doris M. Ching

Vice Chair
