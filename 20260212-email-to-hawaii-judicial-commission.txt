To the Commission:

I am in receipt of your office=E2=80=99s determination that no further resp=
onses to
my correspondence will be forthcoming. I write now not in expectation of
reply, but to establish a clear record of what your silence constitutes
under applicable law.

Your office is in possession of primary-source evidence documenting the
suborning of perjury by a sitting judge and the subsequent sealing of a
record containing fabricated defamatory content =E2=80=94 acts which, if
substantiated, constitute federal criminal conduct under 18 U.S.C. =C2=A7 1=
622
and potentially 18 U.S.C. =C2=A7 1519.

Your declination of jurisdiction on procedural grounds does not extinguish
the evidentiary record now in your possession. It does, however, raise a
serious question of institutional culpability.
A body chartered to investigate judicial misconduct that receives credible
evidence of criminal conduct by a judicial officer and elects neither to
investigate nor to refer has not exercised discretion. It has exercised
complicity. The legal distinction between failing to act and choosing not
to act collapses entirely when the choice is documented, as yours now is.

I would direct the Commission=E2=80=99s attention to the well-established p=
rinciple
that knowledge of a crime, combined with an affirmative decision to
suppress or decline investigation of that crime, can constitute obstruction
under federal law. Your office=E2=80=99s written refusal to engage further =
with
this matter does not insulate the Commission. It memorializes the
Commission=E2=80=99s position for any subsequent inquiry.

All prior submissions, this correspondence, and your office=E2=80=99s respo=
nses =E2=80=94
including the decision to cease responding =E2=80=94 are preserved in a
comprehensive evidentiary dossier currently under preparation for both
publication and federal referral.

The Commission=E2=80=99s cooperation is not required. The record is suffici=
ent.
