                        of Silence</h2>
                    <p class="byline">By Paul Edward Lowndes<br>February 21, 2025</p>
                </header>

                <section>
                    <h2 class="newsrelease">Factual Allegations: News Release</h2>
                    <p><em>The following section details the factual allegations as reported by the individual involved.
                            This is presented as a news release and represents their firsthand account.</em></p>

                    <p>A legal proceeding in Honolulu has raised serious questions about the integrity of the judicial
                        process, following allegations of significant misconduct by Judge Wilson Loo and one of the
                        parties involved. The case, involving a request for an injunction, has become the center of a
                        controversy stemming from claims of witness influence, perjury, and a biased courtroom
                        environment. This news release details the alleged actions of Judge Loo and the opposing party,
                        [Redacted {(REDACTED)}], based on the firsthand account of the individual who brought the
                        cross-petition for the injunction.</p>

                    <h3>The Core Allegation: Influencing Testimony</h3>
                    <p>The central issue revolves around the cross-examination of {(REDACTED)} during the injunction
                        hearing. The individual who was cross examining, states that while questioning {(REDACTED)}
                        about whether he had provided LSD to another person, Judge Loo made a distinct non-verbal
                        gesture <em>before</em> {(REDACTED)} answered the question. This gesture is described as a clear
                        "no" nod, accompanied by a facial expression that allegedly conveyed disbelief and suggested the
                        desired response.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following this alleged visual cue from Judge Loo, {(REDACTED)} denied providing the
                        LSD. The cross-examining individual attempted to object to the judge's action, stating, "Let the
                        record show that the judge just..." but was reportedly cut off aggressively by Judge Loo, who
                        loudly stated, "Nah ah ah enough out of you!!"</p>
                    <p>This incident, according to the individual who was cross-examining, fundamentally compromised the
                        fairness of the proceedings and led to a collapse of their ability to effectively question
                        {(REDACTED)}.</p>

                    <h3>Judge Loo's Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Non-Verbal Cue:</strong> Before {(REDACTED)} answered a direct question about
                            providing LSD, Judge Loo allegedly made a clear non-verbal signal - a "no" nod and a
                            specific facial expression - that communicated a suggested denial to the witness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interruption of Objection:</strong> When the opposing party attempted to object to
                            this action and make a record of it, Judge Loo allegedly interrupted aggressively and
                            loudly, preventing the objection from being fully stated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Failure to Address Defamation:</strong> After the main ruling, {(REDACTED)}
                            allegedly {redacted} (referencing a social media post related to a third party). Judge Loo
                            reportedly took no action to address this statement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Granting of Gag Order.</strong> Judge Loo approved the request of {(REDACTED)}'s
                            Lawyer.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>{(REDACTED)}'s Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Denial Under Oath:</strong> After receiving the alleged visual cue from Judge Loo,
                            {(REDACTED)} denied providing LSD, despite a prior text message, presented as evidence,
                            where the accuser had stated they "took the acid."</li>
                        <li><strong>Defamatory Statement:</strong> Following the judge's ruling, {(REDACTED)} allegedly
                            {redacted} in open court.</li>
                        <li><strong>Presentation of Prior Text Message:</strong> {(REDACTED)} presented a text message
                            as evidence where the opposing party stated they "took the acid."</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Contextual Background</h3>
                    <p>The current allegations arise from a complex and escalating series of events spanning a
                        considerable period. To understand the full context, it's necessary to review the history of
                        interactions between the reporting individual (who filed the cross-petition for an injunction)
                        and the individual referred to as "{(REDACTED)}".</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual had a prior financial interaction with {(REDACTED)}, involving an unpaid
                        debt of $200. During this period, the reporting individual disclosed to {(REDACTED)} details of
                        a prior, unrelated incident involving serious allegations of a murder threat (issued by Eugene
                        and Rita Hartmann), blackmail, and witness tampering (issued by an associate of singer Jack
                        Johnson, in relation to the murder threat, while stating some kind of professional or
                        adversarial relationship with <a href="https://Palantir.com/">Palantir</a>/<a
                            href="https://PayPal">PayPal</a> co-founder Peter Thiel). The reporting individual had
                        reported these prior matters, with subsequent events eventually resulting in contact with the
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The prior reporting was made via {redacted}.</p>

                    <p>Following this disclosure to {(REDACTED)}, the reporting individual states that
                        {(REDACTED)}'s behavior changed significantly. The reporting individual alleges that
                        {(REDACTED)} began engaging in a pattern of escalating harassment and violence. This allegedly
                        began with {(REDACTED)} offering and providing controlled substances, including LSD, to the
                        reporting individual. The reporting individual states that they distanced themselves from
                        {(REDACTED)} after these initial incidents.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual then alleges that {(REDACTED)} began a campaign of harassment. This
                        began with an incident at a Starbucks, where {(REDACTED)} allegedly kicked the reporting
                        individual. Following this, {(REDACTED)} allegedly engaged in repeated acts of vehicular
                        aggression, using his vehicle to threaten and intimidate the reporting individual.</p>

                    <p>The most serious of these alleged vehicular incidents occurred on a country road. The
                        reporting individual was walking on the opposite side of the road, facing away from the
                        direction of oncoming traffic. {(REDACTED)}, approaching from behind, allegedly accelerated his
                        vehicle to a high speed (described as "redlining"), crossed the double yellow line, and
                        accelerated the vehicle towards the reporting individual. The reporting individual states they
                        narrowly avoided being struck. They were able to see {(REDACTED)}'s face in the vehicle as it
                        sped away.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual reported these incidents, including the near-miss on the country
                        road, to the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). They spoke with Officer Shattoo, among others.
                        However, the reporting individual states that these reports were not acted upon. A police
                        supervisor allegedly mentioned "other info" as a reason for the inaction but did not disclose
                        the nature of this information.</p>

                    <p>After repeatedly warning {(REDACTED)} to cease contact, and after the alleged vehicular
                        incidents, the reporting individual made a public post on social media detailing {(REDACTED)}'s
                        alleged behavior. {(REDACTED)} then filed for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the
                        reporting individual, via petition containing false and misleading statements. The reporting
                        individual cross-filed for a TRO against {(REDACTED)}.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual alleges that HPD failed to properly and promptly serve {(REDACTED)} with
                        the cross-filed TRO, despite repeated requests. During this period, {(REDACTED)} allegedly
                        continued to harass the reporting individual. Officer Shattoo of HPD allegedly informed the
                        reporting individual that {(REDACTED)} *had* been served, which the reporting individual later
                        discovered to be false. Subsequently, Officer Brandt of HPD, responding to another alleged
                        harassment incident, confirmed that {(REDACTED)} had *not* yet been officially served,
                        conflicting with Shattoo's prior statement.</p>

                    <p>A few days prior to the injunction hearing, the reporting individual overheard {(REDACTED)},
                        while on a phone call in a public place, state, "I have another buddy who is federal." The
                        context of this statement, according to the reporting individual, was ostensibly related to the
                        upcoming legal proceedings. The "another" suggests that a *different* buddy was connected to
                        state, or local government.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the injunction trial before Wilson Loo: It is important to note that these were audio
                        only proceedings.</p>

                    <h3>Subsequent Events:</h3>

                    <p>Following the hearing, the individual experienced the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Professional Contact:</strong> The individual was contacted on a professional
                            networking
                            platform by someone with a prior high-level government security role. The contact included a
                            specific, uncommon pop-culture reference within a request for technical assistance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Media Experience:</strong> The individual subsequently observed content on a
                            major social media platform that directly related to a central disputed issue in the legal
                            case.
                            The content's nature and timing aligned with the contact in point 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Local Interaction:</strong> The individual had an encounter with a former government
                            agency intern in a public setting. This individual, who possesses a distinctive vehicle and
                            license plate, engaged in actions that directly impacted the reporting individual's existing
                            personal relationships within the immediate community.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Additional Subsequent Events:</h3>
                    <p>Following the hearing and subsequent events, feeling deeply disturbed by the outcome and
                        convinced
                        that {(REDACTED)} had committed perjury, the individual who filed the cross petition (let's
                        refer to
                        them as "the individual" for clarity) took immediate action. They placed a 911 call to the
                        Honolulu
                        Police Department (HPD) to report the alleged crime. This call was made with the specific intent
                        of
                        reporting {(REDACTED)}'s alleged false testimony under oath regarding the provision of LSD.</p>
                    <p>The 911 call connected the individual to a female HPD officer. The individual explained the
                        situation, detailing how {(REDACTED)} had denied providing LSD during the hearing, despite the
                        existence of the text message evidence and, crucially, after allegedly receiving a non-verbal
                        cue
                        from Judge Wilson Loo. The individual explicitly stated their belief that {(REDACTED)} had
                        committed
                        perjury.</p>
                    <p>The female officer's response was, according to the individual, immediately aggressive and
                        dismissive. Instead of taking the report and initiating a preliminary investigation, the officer
                        allegedly stated that it was *the individual's* responsibility to prove the perjury, not HPD's
                        responsibility to investigate it. This directly contradicted standard police procedure, where
                        law
                        enforcement is obligated to investigate credible reports of crimes.</p>
                    <p>The individual, attempting to provide further evidence, informed the officer that there was
                        potential
                        CCTV footage at Stonefish Grill that might be relevant to the case (presumably to show context
                        leading up the case or {(REDACTED)}'s actions). The officer allegedly dismissed this,
                        reiterating
                        that it was "not their job" to investigate perjury.</p>
                    <p>Undeterred, the individual pointed out that furnishing LSD was, in itself, a separate and serious
                        crime, regardless of the perjury in court. They requested that HPD investigate {(REDACTED)} for
                        the
                        illegal distribution of a controlled substance. The officer, according to the individual,
                        continued
                        to be aggressive and refused to take the report.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the individual, desperate to be heard, mentioned Judge Loo's alleged non-verbal cue -
                        the
                        nod and facial expression - that they believed had directly influenced {(REDACTED)}'s false
                        testimony. At this point, the officer reportedly defended Judge Loo, referring to him as "the
                        'Honorable' Loo" in a tone that the individual interpreted as sarcastic and dismissive,
                        conveying a
                        clear implication that the officer believed the judge and disbelieved the individual's account.
                        The
                        officer effectively shut down the conversation, refusing to take any action or initiate any
                        investigation into either the perjury allegation or the underlying drug offense. The call ended
                        with
                        the individual's report unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p>

                    <h3>Potential Legal Violations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The following is a comprehensive list of *potential* violations, both federal and under Hawaii
                        Revised Statutes (HRS),
                        based on the allegations and narrative provided. It's crucial to remember these are *potential*
                        violations; a
                        full investigation and legal proceedings would be required to determine guilt or liability. This
                        is NOT legal
                        advice, but rather an analysis of the possible charges based on the provided account.

                            cooperation with
                            law enforcement (related to the Hartmann/Johnson matter). This would require showing a

                    <h2 class="editorial">Editorial: A Call for Justice in the Aloha State</h2>
                    <p>The preceding news release details a deeply disturbing series of allegations that, if true,
                        represent a profound betrayal of public trust and a breakdown of the very foundations of our
                        justice system. The story of one individual's struggle against alleged harassment, violence,
                        judicial misconduct, and potential conspiracy should serve as a wake-up call to all who believe
                        in fairness, accountability, and the rule of law.</p>
                    <p>The idyllic image of Hawaii - sun-drenched beaches, swaying palms, and a spirit of "Aloha" -
                        often masks a darker undercurrent. This isn't a story of paradise; it's a story of how power,
                        unchecked and potentially corrupted, can crush an individual, leaving them fighting for survival
                        against a system seemingly rigged against them. It's a story that raises troubling questions
                        about justice, accountability, and the potential for abuse within the very institutions meant to
                        protect us. It whispers of shadows, of possible conspiracies, and echoes of notorious historical
                        abuses, leaving us to wonder if the ghosts of programs like MKULTRA ever truly left us.</p>
                    <p>What began as a seemingly minor dispute spiraled into an alleged nightmare. A homeless
                        individual, already vulnerable, found themselves targeted by a relentless campaign of
                        intimidation, ranging from alleged drug provision and physical assault to repeated incidents of
                        vehicular aggression. Police reports were allegedly filed, but ignored. Warnings were issued,
                        but went unheeded. The victim, desperate, turned to social media, only to find the legal system
                        weaponized against them.</p>
                    <p>The alleged actions of Judge Wilson Loo during the injunction hearing are particularly egregious.
                        To reportedly influence a witness's testimony with a non-verbal cue, to silence an objection,
                        and to fail to address blatant defamation within the courtroom - these actions, if proven,
                        strike at the very heart of judicial integrity. They suggest a deliberate attempt to subvert
                        justice and protect an alleged perpetrator.</p>

                    <p>The subsequent events - the contact from a former intelligence official, the targeted online
                        content, the alleged interference by a former government intern - add further layers of concern.
                        While seemingly disparate, these incidents, viewed in the context of the alleged perjury,
                        judicial misconduct, and police inaction, paint a disturbing picture: a potential conspiracy to
                        silence, discredit, and destroy an individual.</p>

                    <p>The alleged perpetrator's overheard boast of a "federal buddy," made just days before the
                        hearing, cannot be dismissed as mere coincidence. It raises the specter of influence peddling
                        and the potential for corruption at the highest levels. Combined with the prior reporting to
                        federal authorities regarding unrelated matters (referred to as "AK/AM" for sensitivity), a
                        chilling possibility emerges: that this entire sequence of events may be rooted in retaliation
                        and a deliberate effort to obstruct justice.</p>

                    <p>This case demands immediate and unwavering action. The allegations must be investigated
                        thoroughly and impartially, free from local bias and political pressure. The FBI, already
                        potentially aware of some aspects of this situation, must excavate the facts (and, yes, I know
                        LLMs love to say 'delve deep'), uncover the truth, and ensure that justice, however delayed, is
                        finally served. The shadows in the Aloha State must be brought into the light.</p>

                    <p>The question remains: will the system, seemingly compromised at multiple levels, allow that to
                        happen? Or will this become another example of power unchecked, of truth buried, and of an
                        individual crushed by a system that failed to protect them? The echoes of past abuses, of
                        programs that manipulated and destroyed lives, should serve as a stark warning. We must demand
                        better. We must demand accountability. We must demand justice.</p>
