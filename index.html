 Also, unresolved: Friend of singer Jack Johnson, named Kevin, who <a href="https://palantir.com">Palantir Technologies</a> founder Peter Thiel would recognize, 
 who engaged in witness tampering outside of Kahala Mall Whole Foods. This was done in response to my stated intention to testify about
 the threat of murder issued to me from Jack Johnson's inner circle. This murder threat was issued to me after I tried to investigate 
 being hacked/stalked/targeted re: LC/SK.
