                    <h2>Open Letter to Honolulu Senior Judge Wilson Loo</h2>
                    <p>
                        Wilson Loo:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am writing to formally address your actions during a recent court proceeding that have raised serious legal concerns. It is evident that you visually led the witness to deny a criminal allegation by nodding “NO” before the denial was issued. This act of judicial misconduct facilitated felony perjury, which is a serious crime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, your obstruction of justice when you prevented me from documenting your misconduct represents a potential crime on your part, given your role as a judge and the high standard of conduct expected of you. The fact that this misconduct was executed with the awareness that you might evade accountability is particularly egregious.
                    </p>
                    <p>         
                        The seriousness of your actions cannot be understated, and I urge you to acknowledge the implications of your behavior in this matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sincerely, <br/>
                        Paul Edward Lowndes  <br/>
                        Haleiwa, Hawaii  <br/>
