 <a href="https://twitter.com/thejusticedept">Dear The Justice Department</a>, 
 
 My latest research project into the ongoing antisocial, maladaptive behavior that is being
 perpetrated by <a href="https://twitter.com/susanwojcicki">"GOOGLE AI"</a> 
 has reached the conclusion of the data collection phase.
 
 I've successfully infiltrated GOOGLE's targeting algo to fuzz out technocratic/sociopathic/automated
 gaslighting behavior (see: <a href="https://twitter.com/fbinewark">"Cutty Newark 1997"</a>). My recommendations
 regarding AI regulation with regard to surveillance data abuse practices will be revised accordingly.
