                    <h1>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h1>
                    <h2>Allegations of Serious Misconduct Surface in Honolulu Courtroom: Witness Claims Judge Influenced
                        Testimony, Sparking Concerns of Perjury and Bias</h2>
                    <p><strong>HONOLULU, HI – FEB 21 2025</strong></p>
                </header>

                <section>
                    <p>A legal proceeding in Honolulu has raised serious questions about the integrity of the judicial
                        process, following allegations of significant misconduct by Judge Wilson Loo and one of the
                        parties involved. The case, involving a request for an injunction, has become the center of a
                        controversy stemming from claims of witness influence, perjury, and a biased courtroom
                        environment. This news release details the alleged actions of Judge Loo and the opposing party,
                        [Redacted {(REDACTED)}], based on the firsthand account of the individual who brought the
                        cross-petition for the injunction.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>The Core Allegation: Influencing Testimony</h3>
                    <p>The central issue revolves around the cross-examination of {(REDACTED)} during the injunction
                        hearing. The individual who was cross examining, states that while questioning {(REDACTED)}
                        about whether he had provided LSD to another person, Judge Loo made a distinct non-verbal
                        gesture <em>before</em> {(REDACTED)} answered the question. This gesture is described as a clear
                        "no" nod, accompanied by a facial expression that allegedly conveyed disbelief and suggested the
                        desired response.</p>
                    <p>Immediately following this alleged visual cue from Judge Loo, {(REDACTED)} denied providing the
                        LSD. The cross-examining individual attempted to object to the judge's action, stating, "Let the
                        record show that the judge just..." but was reportedly cut off aggressively by Judge Loo, who
                        loudly stated, "Nah ah ah enough out of you!!!!!"</p>
                    <p>This incident, according to the individual who was cross-examining, fundamentally compromised the
                        fairness of the proceedings and led to a collapse of their ability to effectively question
                        {(REDACTED)}.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Judge Loo's Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
                    <p>The following is a summary of Judge Loo's alleged actions, based on the firsthand account:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Non-Verbal Cue:</strong> Before {(REDACTED)} answered a direct question about
                            providing LSD, Judge Loo allegedly made a clear non-verbal signal – a "no" nod and a
                            specific facial expression – that communicated a suggested denial to the witness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interruption of Objection:</strong> When the opposing party attempted to object to
                            this action and make a record of it, Judge Loo allegedly interrupted aggressively and
                            loudly, preventing the objection from being fully stated.</li>
                        <li><strong>Failure to Address Defamation:</strong> After the main ruling, {(REDACTED)}
                            allegedly {redacted} (referencing a social media post related to a third party). Judge Loo
                            reportedly took no action to address this statement.</li>
                        <li><strong>Granting of Gag Order.</strong> Judge Loo approved the request of {(REDACTED)}'s
                            Lawyer.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                    <h3>{(REDACTED)}'s Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
                    <p>The following is a summary of {(REDACTED)}'s alleged actions, based on the firsthand account:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Denial Under Oath:</strong> After receiving the alleged visual cue from Judge Loo,
                            {(REDACTED)} denied providing LSD, despite a prior text message, presented as evidence,
                            where the accuser had stated they "took the acid."</li>
                        <li><strong>Defamatory Statement:</strong> Following the judge's ruling, {(REDACTED)} allegedly
                            {redacted} in open court.</li>
                        <li><strong>Presentation of Prior Text Message:</strong> {(REDACTED)} presented a text message
                            as evidence where the opposing party stated they "took the acid."</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Potential Motives and Connections (Public Disclosure)</h3>
                    <p>Understanding the potential motives behind the alleged actions is crucial for context. The
                        following information is presented based on the reporting individual's firsthand account and
                        publicly available information, with careful consideration for legal sensitivities. I, PAUL
                        EDWARD LOWNDES, OF HALEIWA, HAWAII, SWEAR UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY I AM MAKING TRUTHFUL
                        STATEMENTS.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>"Federal Buddy" Statement:</strong> Two days prior to the injunction hearing, the
                            individual who would later be accused of perjury (referred to as "{(REDACTED)}" due to a
                            court order) was reportedly overheard stating, "I have another buddy who is federal," while
                            speaking on the phone. This statement was made in a public place, within earshot of the
                            reporting individual. The context was {redacted}. The "another" suggests that a *different*
                            buddy was connected to state, or local government.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prior Reporting and Retaliation Concerns:</strong> The reporting individual had,
                            previous to this entire series of events with {(REDACTED)}, made reports concerning an
                            unrelated matter. These reports involved a different set of circumstances. The individual
                            believes that there may be a retaliatory motive stemming from those prior disclosures,
                            although the specific nature of that potential connection is not being publicly disclosed at
                            this time to avoid jeopardizing any ongoing investigations or sensitive information. It can
                            be publicly stated, however, the reporting was conducted via SS-7.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-Existing Context of Threats and Retaliation:</strong> It is crucial to
                            understand that the reporting individual had previously experienced a serious and documented
                            series of events that established a pattern of threats, intimidation, and potential official
                            misconduct. These prior events, which predate the interactions with {(REDACTED)}, involved
                            the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>The reporting individual was allegedly threatened with murder by individuals named
                                    Eugene and Rita Hartmann.</li>
                                <li>This threat reportedly escalated into a situation involving blackmail and witness
                                    tampering, allegedly orchestrated by an associate of an individual named Jack
                                    Johnson. The reporting individual asserts that the blackmail and witness tampering
                                    were intended to cover up the original murder threat and the underlying crime that
                                    precipitated it.</li>
                                <li>The reporting individual reported these incidents, which, they state, led to
                                    retaliation from a "mob-connected felon" with alleged assistance from the Honolulu
                                    Police Department (HPD).</li>
                                <li>These events resulted in contact between the reporting individual and the Federal
                                    Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</li>
                            </ul>
                            This pre-existing history establishes a documented pattern of threats, alleged official
                            misconduct, and federal involvement, creating a context in which the reporting individual
                            had reason to be concerned about further retaliation. Crucially, the reporting individual
                            states that they *disclosed* these prior events and the associated concerns to {(REDACTED)}
                            *before* the alleged harassment and legal dispute with {(REDACTED)} escalated.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The temporal proximity of the "federal buddy" statement to the injunction hearing, combined with
                        the subsequent alleged perjury, judicial misconduct, HPD inaction, and the unusual contacts
                        described previously, raises a reasonable suspicion of a coordinated effort to influence the
                        legal outcome and potentially retaliate against the reporting individual. The specific nature of
                        the "federal" connection, the pre-existing history of threats and retaliation, and the precise
                        mechanisms of any alleged coordination, remain areas requiring further investigation.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Contextual Background</h3>
                    <p>The current allegations arise from a complex and escalating series of events spanning a
                        considerable period. To understand the full context, it's necessary to review the history of
                        interactions between the reporting individual (who filed the cross-petition for an injunction)
                        and the individual referred to as "{(REDACTED)}".</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual had a prior financial interaction with {(REDACTED)}, involving an unpaid
                        debt of $200. During this period, the reporting individual disclosed to {(REDACTED)} details of
                        a prior, unrelated incident involving serious allegations of a murder threat (issued by Eugene
                        and Rita Hartmann), blackmail, and witness tampering (issued by an associate of singer Jack
                        Johnson, in relation to the murder threat, while stating some kind of professional or
                        adversarial relationship with Palatir co-founder Peter Thiel). The reporting individual had
                        reported these prior matters, with subsequent events eventually resulting in contact with the
                        Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>

                    <p>Following this disclosure to {(REDACTED)}, the reporting individual states that
                        {(REDACTED)}'s behavior changed significantly. The reporting individual alleges that
                        {(REDACTED)} began engaging in a pattern of escalating harassment and violence. This allegedly
                        began with {(REDACTED)} offering and providing controlled substances, including LSD, to the
                        reporting individual. The reporting individual states that they distanced themselves from
                        {(REDACTED)} after these initial incidents.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual then alleges that {(REDACTED)} began a campaign of harassment. This
                        began with an incident at a Starbucks, where {(REDACTED)} allegedly kicked the reporting
                        individual. Following this, {(REDACTED)} allegedly engaged in repeated acts of vehicular
                        aggression, using his vehicle to threaten and intimidate the reporting individual.</p>

                    <p>The most serious of these alleged vehicular incidents occurred on a country road. The
                        reporting individual was walking on the opposite side of the road, facing away from the
                        direction of oncoming traffic. {(REDACTED)}, approaching from behind, allegedly accelerated his
                        vehicle to a high speed (described as "redlining"), crossed the double yellow line, and
                        accelerated the vehicle towards the reporting individual. The reporting individual states they
                        narrowly avoided being struck. They were able to see {(REDACTED)}'s face in the vehicle as it
                        sped away.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual reported these incidents, including the near-miss on the country
                        road, to the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). They spoke with Officer Shattoo, among others.
                        However, the reporting individual states that these reports were not acted upon. A police
                        supervisor allegedly mentioned "other info" as a reason for the inaction but did not disclose
                        the nature of this information.</p>

                    <p>After repeatedly warning {(REDACTED)} to cease contact, and after the alleged vehicular
                        incidents, the reporting individual made a public post on social media detailing {(REDACTED)}'s
                        alleged behavior. {(REDACTED)} then filed for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) against the
                        reporting individual, via petition containing false and misleading statements. The reporting
                        individual cross-filed for a TRO against {(REDACTED)}.</p>

                    <p>The reporting individual alleges that HPD failed to properly and promptly serve {(REDACTED)} with
                        the cross-filed TRO, despite repeated requests. During this period, {(REDACTED)} allegedly
                        continued to harass the reporting individual. Officer Shattoo of HPD allegedly informed the
                        reporting individual that {(REDACTED)} *had* been served, which the reporting individual later
                        discovered to be false. Subsequently, Officer Brandt of HPD, responding to another alleged
                        harassment incident, confirmed that {(REDACTED)} had *not* yet been officially served,
                        conflicting with Shattoo's prior statement.</p>

                    <p>A few days prior to the injunction hearing, the reporting individual overheard {(REDACTED)},
                        while on a phone call in a public place, state, "I have another buddy who is federal." The
                        context of this statement, according to the reporting individual, was ostensibly related to the
                        upcoming legal proceedings. The "another" suggests that a *different* buddy was connected to
                        state, or local government.</p>

                    <p>Regarding the injunction trial before Wilson Loo: It is important to note that these were audio
                        only proceedings.</p>

                </section>

                <h3>Subsequent Events:</h3>

                <p>Following the hearing, the individual experienced the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Professional Contact:</strong> The individual was contacted on a professional networking
                        platform by someone with a prior high-level government security role. The contact included a
                        specific, uncommon pop-culture reference within a request for technical assistance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Media Experience:</strong> The individual subsequently observed content on a
                        major social media platform that directly related to a central disputed issue in the legal case.
                        The content's nature and timing aligned with the contact in point 1.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Interaction:</strong> The individual had an encounter with a former government
                        agency intern in a public setting. This individual, who possesses a distinctive vehicle and
                        license plate, engaged in actions that directly impacted the reporting individual's existing
                        personal relationships within the immediate community.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Additional Subsequent Events:</h3>
                <p>Following the hearing and subsequent events, feeling deeply disturbed by the outcome and convinced
                    that {(REDACTED)} had committed perjury, the individual who filed the cross petition (let's refer to
                    them as "the individual" for clarity) took immediate action. They placed a 911 call to the Honolulu
                    Police Department (HPD) to report the alleged crime. This call was made with the specific intent of
                    reporting {(REDACTED)}'s alleged false testimony under oath regarding the provision of LSD.</p>
                <p>The 911 call connected the individual to a female HPD officer. The individual explained the
                    situation, detailing how {(REDACTED)} had denied providing LSD during the hearing, despite the
                    existence of the text message evidence and, crucially, after allegedly receiving a non-verbal cue
                    from Judge Wilson Loo. The individual explicitly stated their belief that {(REDACTED)} had committed
                    perjury.</p>
                <p>The female officer's response was, according to the individual, immediately aggressive and
                    dismissive. Instead of taking the report and initiating a preliminary investigation, the officer
                    allegedly stated that it was *the individual's* responsibility to prove the perjury, not HPD's
                    responsibility to investigate it. This directly contradicted standard police procedure, where law
                    enforcement is obligated to investigate credible reports of crimes.</p>
                <p>The individual, attempting to provide further evidence, informed the officer that there was potential
                    CCTV footage at Stonefish Grill that might be relevant to the case (presumably to show context
                    leading up the case or {(REDACTED)}'s actions). The officer allegedly dismissed this, reiterating
                    that it was "not their job" to investigate perjury.</p>
                <p>Undeterred, the individual pointed out that furnishing LSD was, in itself, a separate and serious
                    crime, regardless of the perjury in court. They requested that HPD investigate {(REDACTED)} for the
                    illegal distribution of a controlled substance. The officer, according to the individual, continued
                    to be aggressive and refused to take the report.</p>
                <p>Finally, the individual, desperate to be heard, mentioned Judge Loo's alleged non-verbal cue – the
                    nod and facial expression – that they believed had directly influenced {(REDACTED)}'s false
                    testimony. At this point, the officer reportedly defended Judge Loo, referring to him as "the
                    'Honorable' Loo" in a tone that the individual interpreted as sarcastic and dismissive, conveying a
                    clear implication that the officer believed the judge and disbelieved the individual's account. The
                    officer effectively shut down the conversation, refusing to take any action or initiate any
                    investigation into either the perjury allegation or the underlying drug offense. The call ended with
                    the individual's report unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p>

                    <h3>Calls for Transparency and Investigation</h3>
                    <p>The allegations detailed in this news release raise profound concerns about the fairness and
                        impartiality of the judicial process in this specific case. The described actions of Judge Loo,
                        if accurate, represent a serious breach of judicial conduct. The alleged actions of {(REDACTED)}
                        raise questions of perjury and defamation. The reported response of HPD raises additional
                        concerns about potential bias and obstruction of justice.</p>
                    <p>This situation demands a thorough and impartial investigation to determine the veracity of the
                        allegations and to ensure accountability for any wrongdoing. The integrity of the judicial
                        system depends on the public's trust that court proceedings are conducted fairly and that all
                        parties are treated equally under the law.</p>

                    <h3>Potential Legal Violations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The following is a comprehensive list of *potential* violations, both federal and under Hawaii
                        Revised Statutes (HRS),
                        based on the allegations and narrative provided. It's crucial to remember these are *potential*
                        violations; a
                        full investigation and legal proceedings would be required to determine guilt or liability. This
                        is NOT legal
                        advice, but rather an analysis of the possible charges based on your account.

                            cooperation with
                            law enforcement (related to the Hartmann/Johnson matter). This would require showing a

                    masks a darker undercurrent. This isn't a story of paradise; it's a story of how power, unchecked
                    and potentially corrupted, can crush an individual, leaving them fighting for survival against a
                    system seemingly rigged against them. It's a story that raises troubling questions about justice,
                    accountability, and the potential for abuse within the very institutions meant to protect us. It
                    whispers of shadows, of possible conspiracies, and echoes of notorious historical abuses, leaving us
                    to wonder if the ghosts of programs like MKULTRA ever truly left us.</p>

                <p>What began as a seemingly minor dispute - a small debt, a disagreement - spiraled into an alleged
                    nightmare of harassment, violence, and legal manipulation. A homeless individual, already
                    vulnerable, found themselves targeted by a relentless campaign of intimidation. It started with
                    alleged drug provision, escalated to physical assault at a coffee shop, and then terrifyingly, to
                    repeated incidents of vehicular aggression, culminating in a near-fatal encounter on a quiet country
                    road where the alleged perpetrator redlined his vehicle, crossing the double yellow line in an act
                    of apparent <em>what I described</em>.</p>

                <p>This wasn't just random violence. It was, according to the victim, a calculated escalation. Police
                    reports were filed, but allegedly ignored. Warnings were issued, but went unheeded. The victim,
                    desperate, turned to social media to expose the alleged perpetrator's actions. This act of seeking
                    public accountability, however, backfired spectacularly.</p>

                <p>The alleged perpetrator, far from being brought to justice, filed for a restraining order. The
                    victim, in turn, cross-filed. But here, the system began to show its cracks. The victim's
                    restraining order was, according to their account, repeatedly *not* served by the police, despite
                    numerous requests. Meanwhile, the alleged harassment continued, seemingly with impunity. The police,
                    when confronted, allegedly offered vague excuses and alluded to "other info," without clarification.
                </p>

                <p>Then came the courtroom drama, a scene that should chill anyone who believes in the sanctity of the
                    judicial process. During an audio-only injunction hearing, while the victim was cross-examining the
                    alleged perpetrator about the crucial issue of drug provision, the presiding judge, according to the
                    victim, made a clear, non-verbal gesture - a "no" nod - *before* the alleged perpetrator answered.
                    The answer, unsurprisingly, was a denial. An attempted objection was silenced, the victim claims,
                    with a harsh and aggressive rebuke from the judge.</p>

                <p>This alleged act of judicial interference - effectively coaching a witness under oath - is the heart
                    of the darkness in this case. It suggests a deliberate attempt to pervert the course of justice, to
                    silence a voice, and to protect an alleged perpetrator. The subsequent defamation *in the
                    courtroom*, unaddressed by the judge, and the imposition of a gag order preventing the victim from
                    speaking publicly about the case, only deepened the sense of injustice.</p>

                <p>But the story doesn't end there. In the aftermath of the hearing, a series of bizarre and unsettling
                    events occurred. A former high-ranking intelligence official contacted the victim, offering "tech
                    support" with an unnerving pop-culture reference, a chilling echo, perhaps unintentional, of
                    mind-control programs of the past. Targeted content appeared on social media, seemingly designed to
                    discredit the victim. A former government intern allegedly interfered with the victim's personal
                    life.</p>

                <p>Taken individually, these incidents might seem insignificant. But viewed collectively, within the
                    context of the alleged perjury, judicial misconduct, and police inaction, they paint a disturbing
                    picture. A picture of a potential conspiracy, a coordinated effort to silence, discredit, and
                    ultimately destroy an individual who dared to speak out.</p>

                <p>The alleged perpetrator, it was overheard, boasted of a "federal buddy." This seemingly casual
                    remark, made just days before the fateful hearing, casts a long shadow. Was this a mere boast, or a
                    hint of a deeper connection, a network of influence extending into the highest levels of power? And
                    what of the prior reporting, the censored details of which point to a potential motive for
                    retaliation, a motive that may reach far beyond the confines of a local dispute? Given previous
                    contacts and the nature of the prior report -- we will call this situation "AK/AM" -- is it a
                    situation where justice is being obstructed?</p>

                <p>This case is a stark reminder that the ideals of justice and equality are fragile. They require
                    constant vigilance, unwavering commitment to transparency, and a willingness to hold those in power
                    accountable. The allegations in this case demand a thorough, independent investigation, free from
                    local bias and political influence. The FBI, already potentially aware of some aspects of this
                    situation, must delve deep, uncover the truth, and ensure that justice, however delayed, is finally
                    served. The shadows in the Aloha State must be brought into the light. The question remains: will
                    the system, seemingly compromised at multiple levels, allow that to happen? Or will this become
                    another example of power unchecked, of truth buried, and of an individual crushed by a system that
                    failed to protect them? The echoes of past abuses, of programs that manipulated and destroyed lives,
                    should serve as a stark warning. We must demand better. We must demand accountability. We must
                    demand justice.</p>
