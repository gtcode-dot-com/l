unresolved incident (one of dozens): "Ok, he's listening now. Henry."

"Alphabet"/Google/Youtube are hostile entities that need to be broken into hundreds of pieces. Good parts shall be placed in a public trust. Data shall be returned to the public.

Alphabet/youtube has since answered, indirectly: "We broker in defamation and will use it against you."
<br>Stay classy, Susan Wojcicki/Sundar Pichai. You guys should do brunch with Dennis, along with his HPD buddy (photo.jpg)

<br><br>Self serving malicious scumbag apes, all of them.

Update July 28, 2022: 
Alphabet/Youtube is still responding to me with targeted harassment/data abuse algorithms, in an amplified manner. Then they blame it on the military. US Military or any US govt agency,
 are you involved with Google's panopticon data abuse practices?

<br><br>
Imagine giving a bunch of petulant children with crayons access to a trillion dollar entity's covert, malicious psychological operations machine, replete with large scale whole-of-society surveillance tied in with undisclosed
big data data hoarding. All it takes is to call them out, in order to invoke a childish billionaire's response.

<br><br>
Ask Google/Sundar Pichai/Susan Wojcicki if I can see the dossier they maintain on me. If not, why? Ask them if they targeted me using the news of DD's suicide. Ask them if they opted
me in, without any semblance of consent, to a real time location based matchmaker algorithm earlier this year.
