    <h1>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</h1>
    <h2>Allegations of Serious Misconduct Surface in Honolulu Courtroom: Witness Claims Judge Influenced Testimony, Sparking Concerns of Perjury and Bias</h2>
    <p><strong>HONOLULU, HI – FEB 21 2025</strong></p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <p>A legal proceeding in Honolulu has raised serious questions about the integrity of the judicial process, following allegations of significant misconduct by Judge Wilson Loo and one of the parties involved. The case, involving a request for an injunction, has become the center of a controversy stemming from claims of witness influence, perjury, and a biased courtroom environment. This news release details the alleged actions of Judge Loo and the opposing party, [Redacted Kindle] (referred to as "Kindle" due to a court-ordered restriction on public disclosure of his name), based on the firsthand account of the individual who brought the cross-petition for the injunction.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>The Core Allegation: Influencing Testimony</h3>
    <p>The central issue revolves around the cross-examination of Kindle during the injunction hearing. The individual who was cross examining, states that while questioning Kindle about whether he had provided LSD to another person, Judge Loo made a distinct non-verbal gesture <em>before</em> Kindle answered the question. This gesture is described as a clear "no" nod, accompanied by a facial expression that allegedly conveyed disbelief and suggested the desired response.</p>
    <p>Immediately following this alleged visual cue from Judge Loo, Kindle denied providing the LSD. The cross-examining individual attempted to object to the judge's action, stating, "Let the record show that the judge just..." but was reportedly cut off aggressively by Judge Loo, who loudly stated, "Nah ah ah enough out of you!!!!!"</p>
    <p>This incident, according to the individual who was cross-examining, fundamentally compromised the fairness of the proceedings and led to a collapse of their ability to effectively question Kindle.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Judge Loo's Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
    <p>The following is a summary of Judge Loo's alleged actions, based on the firsthand account:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Non-Verbal Cue:</strong> Before Kindle answered a direct question about providing LSD, Judge Loo allegedly made a clear non-verbal signal – a "no" nod and a specific facial expression – that communicated a suggested denial to the witness.</li>
      <li><strong>Interruption of Objection:</strong> When the opposing party attempted to object to this action and make a record of it, Judge Loo allegedly interrupted aggressively and loudly, preventing the objection from being fully stated.</li>
      <li><strong>Failure to Address Defamation:</strong> After the main ruling, Kindle allegedly {redacted} (referencing a social media post related to a third party). Judge Loo reportedly took no action to address this statement.</li>
      <li><strong>Granting of Gag Order.</strong> Judge Loo approved the request of Kindle's Lawyer.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Kindle's Actions: A Detailed Account</h3>
    <p>The following is a summary of Kindle's alleged actions, based on the firsthand account:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Denial Under Oath:</strong> After receiving the alleged visual cue from Judge Loo, Kindle denied providing LSD, despite a prior text message, presented as evidence, where the accuser had stated they "took the acid."</li>
      <li><strong>Defamatory Statement:</strong> Following the judge's ruling, Kindle allegedly {redacted} in open court.</li>
      <li><strong>Presentation of Prior Text Message:</strong> Kindle presented a text message as evidence where the opposing party stated they "took the acid."</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Potential Motives and Connections (Public Disclosure)</h3>
        <p>Understanding the potential motives behind the alleged actions is crucial for context. The following information is presented based on the reporting individual's firsthand account and publicly available information, with careful consideration for legal sensitivities. I, PAUL EDWARD LOWNDES, OF HALEIWA, HAWAII, SWEAR UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY I AM MAKING TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>"Federal Buddy" Statement:</strong> Two days prior to the injunction hearing, the individual who would later be accused of perjury (referred to as "Kindle" due to a court order) was reportedly overheard stating, "I have another buddy who is federal," while speaking on the phone. This statement was made in a public place, within earshot of the reporting individual. The context was a discussion related to the impending legal proceedings.  The "another" suggests that a *different* buddy was connected to state, or local government.</li>
            <li><strong>Prior Reporting and Retaliation Concerns:</strong> The reporting individual had, previous to this entire series of events with Kindle, made reports concerning an unrelated matter. These reports involved a different set of circumstances.  The individual believes that there may be a retaliatory motive stemming from those prior disclosures, although the specific nature of that potential connection is not being publicly disclosed at this time to avoid jeopardizing any ongoing investigations or sensitive information. It can be publicly stated, however, the reporting was on form SS-7.</li>
             <li><strong>Pre-Existing Context of Threats and Retaliation:</strong> It is crucial to understand that the reporting individual had previously experienced a serious and documented series of events that established a pattern of threats, intimidation, and potential official misconduct. These prior events, which predate the interactions with Kindle, involved the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The reporting individual was allegedly threatened with murder by individuals named Eugene and Rita Hartmann.</li>
                    <li>This threat reportedly escalated into a situation involving blackmail and witness tampering, allegedly orchestrated by an associate of an individual named Jack Johnson. The reporting individual asserts that the blackmail and witness tampering were intended to cover up the original murder threat and the underlying crime that precipitated it.</li>
                    <li>The reporting individual reported these incidents, which, they state, led to retaliation from a "mob-connected felon" with alleged assistance from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD).</li>
                    <li>These events resulted in contact between the reporting individual and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</li>
                </ul>
                This pre-existing history establishes a documented pattern of threats, alleged official misconduct, and federal involvement, creating a context in which the reporting individual had reason to be concerned about further retaliation.  Crucially, the reporting individual states that they *disclosed* these prior events and the associated concerns to Kindle *before* the alleged harassment and legal dispute with Kindle escalated.
            </li>
       </ol>
        <p>The temporal proximity of the "federal buddy" statement to the injunction hearing, combined with the subsequent alleged perjury, judicial misconduct, HPD inaction, and the unusual contacts described previously, raises a reasonable suspicion of a coordinated effort to influence the legal outcome and potentially retaliate against the reporting individual. The specific nature of the "federal" connection, the pre-existing history of threats and retaliation, and the precise mechanisms of any alleged coordination, remain areas requiring further investigation.</p>
    </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Contextual Background</h3>
    <p>It is important to note that these were audio only proceedings.</p>
    <p>Prior to the injunction hearing, the individual filing the cross petition alleges a pattern of escalating harassment by Kindle, including vehicular incidents and verbal abuse. These allegations were reported to the Honolulu Police Department (HPD). The individual also claims that HPD failed to properly serve Kindle with a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) they had obtained, despite repeated requests. A further allegation involves an HPD officer falsely claiming Kindle had been served.</p>
      <h3>Subsequent Events:</h3>
      <p>Following the hearing, feeling deeply disturbed by the outcome and convinced that Kindle had committed perjury, the individual who filed the cross petition (let's refer to them as "the individual" for clarity) took immediate action. They placed a 911 call to the Honolulu Police Department (HPD) to report the alleged crime. This call was made with the specific intent of reporting Kindle's alleged false testimony under oath regarding the provision of LSD.</p>
      <p>The 911 call connected the individual to a female HPD officer. The individual explained the situation, detailing how Kindle had denied providing LSD during the hearing, despite the existence of the text message evidence and, crucially, after allegedly receiving a non-verbal cue from Judge Wilson Loo. The individual explicitly stated their belief that Kindle had committed perjury.</p>
      <p>The female officer's response was, according to the individual, immediately aggressive and dismissive. Instead of taking the report and initiating a preliminary investigation, the officer allegedly stated that it was *the individual's* responsibility to prove the perjury, not HPD's responsibility to investigate it. This directly contradicted standard police procedure, where law enforcement is obligated to investigate credible reports of crimes.</p>
      <p>The individual, attempting to provide further evidence, informed the officer that there was potential CCTV footage at Stonefish Grill that might be relevant to the case (presumably to show context leading up the case or Kindle's actions). The officer allegedly dismissed this, reiterating that it was "not their job" to investigate perjury.</p>
      <p>Undeterred, the individual pointed out that furnishing LSD was, in itself, a separate and serious crime, regardless of the perjury in court. They requested that HPD investigate Kindle for the illegal distribution of a controlled substance. The officer, according to the individual, continued to be aggressive and refused to take the report.</p>
      <p>Finally, the individual, desperate to be heard, mentioned Judge Loo's alleged non-verbal cue – the nod and facial expression – that they believed had directly influenced Kindle's false testimony. At this point, the officer reportedly defended Judge Loo, referring to him as "the 'Honorable' Loo" in a tone that the individual interpreted as sarcastic and dismissive, conveying a clear implication that the officer believed the judge and disbelieved the individual's account. The officer effectively shut down the conversation, refusing to take any action or initiate any investigation into either the perjury allegation or the underlying drug offense. The call ended with the individual's report unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p>

      <h3>Additional Subsequent Events:</h3>

    <p>Following the hearing and the interaction with law enforcement, the individual experienced the following:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Professional Contact:</strong> The individual was contacted on a professional networking platform by someone with a prior high-level government security role. The contact included a specific, uncommon pop-culture reference within a request for technical assistance.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Media Experience:</strong>  The individual subsequently observed content on a major social media platform that directly related to a central disputed issue in the legal case.  The content's nature and timing aligned with the contact in point 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Interaction:</strong> The individual had an encounter with a former government agency intern in a public setting. This individual, who possesses a distinctive vehicle and license plate, engaged in actions that directly impacted the reporting individual's existing personal relationships within the immediate community.</li>
</ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Calls for Transparency and Investigation</h3>
    <p>The allegations detailed in this news release raise profound concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the judicial process in this specific case. The described actions of Judge Loo, if accurate, represent a serious breach of judicial conduct. The alleged actions of Kindle raise questions of perjury and defamation. The reported response of HPD raises additional concerns about potential bias and obstruction of justice.</p>
    <p>This situation demands a thorough and impartial investigation to determine the veracity of the allegations and to ensure accountability for any wrongdoing. The integrity of the judicial system depends on the public's trust that court proceedings are conducted fairly and that all parties are treated equally under the law.</p>
