# **HIERARCHIES OF INFLUENCE: A FORENSIC MAPPING OF THE STANLEY-KANEMOTO-YUEN TRIAD AND THE LUKE-LOO NETWORK**

## **1\. Introduction: The Anatomy of Hawaii’s Interlocking Directorates**

The socio-political landscape of Hawaii is often characterized by a high degree of connectivity among its legal, financial, and administrative elites. This phenomenon, frequently described as an "interlocking directorate," creates a network ecosystem where a relatively small cohort of individuals circulates between public service, private practice, philanthropic governance, and judicial oversight. This report provides an exhaustive forensic analysis of one such network cluster: the intersection of **Audrey Stanley**, **Vincent Kanemoto**, and **James Yuen** with the established hegemony of the **Luke-Loo network**.

The "Luke-Loo network" is defined herein as the concerted influence of **Wilson Loo**, **Janice Luke Loo**, and the corporate interests of **Hawaii National Bank (HNB)**. The Luke family, founders of Hawaii National Bank, represents a historic pillar of local banking, while the Loo extension of the family has deeply integrated into the state’s judicial and legal infrastructure.

The core objective of this analysis is to rigorously identify, verify, and contextualize the "connective tissue" between these entities. The investigation reveals that while direct, simultaneous board memberships between the subjects and the Luke-Loo core are infrequent, the subjects are inextricably bound to the Luke-Loo sphere through a shared ecosystem of **judicial regulation**, **legal antagonism**, and **philanthropic patronage**.

### **1.1. Scope and Methodology**

This report utilizes a diverse array of primary source materials, including:

* **Judiciary Annual Reports (2001–2023):** To track board tenures and commission appointments.  
* **Financial Disclosure Statements:** To cross-reference self-reported affiliations against official rosters.  
* **Appellate Court Records:** To identify professional intersections in litigation.  
* **Institutional Annual Reports:** Specifically from the Palolo Chinese Home and Punahou School, to map social capital.

The analysis operates on three levels of connectivity:

1. **First-Order Connections:** Direct overlaps in employment, board service, or co-donorship (e.g., James Yuen and Hawaii National Bank).  
2. **Second-Order Connections:** Professional hierarchy and regulatory relationships (e.g., Janice Luke Loo’s oversight of Audrey Stanley’s profession).  
3. **Third-Order Connections:** Shared cultural or educational antecedents (e.g., the Punahou School alumni network).

### **1.2. The Luke-Loo Hegemony: Defining the Center**

To understand how Stanley, Kanemoto, and Yuen relate to the "Luke-Loo" interest, one must first delineate the extent of the Luke-Loo footprint. It is not merely a commercial interest; it is a sprawling institutional presence that bridges the gap between private wealth and public order.

**Wilson Loo** serves as the primary pivot point. His career is characterized by a duality unique to the Hawaii legal market: he functioned simultaneously as a managing partner of a major law firm specializing in foreign investment and mergers 1, and as a **Per Diem Judge** for nearly three decades.1 This dual status placed him in a position of immense, albeit quiet, influence—practicing law among peers while simultaneously holding adjudicatory power over them in District and Family courts.

**Janice Luke Loo** complements this role through her service on the **Commission on Judicial Conduct (CJC)**. The CJC is the constitutional body responsible for investigating ethical complaints against judges. Her tenure on this commission was extraordinary in its length, spanning over twenty years from 2001 to 2022\.2 This longevity suggests not just service, but stewardship—a consistent "Luke" voice in the room where judicial careers are scrutinized.

The **Hawaii National Bank (HNB)** interest acts as the financial engine of this network, providing the capital for philanthropic signaling, particularly through historic institutions like the **Palolo Chinese Home**.

The subjects of this inquiry—Stanley, Kanemoto, and Yuen—interact with this hegemony not as unified blocks, but as distinct satellites, each engaging with a different facet of the Luke-Loo diamond: Stanley with the Judiciary, Kanemoto with the State Executive, and Yuen with the Administrative/Philanthropic sphere.

**2\. The Judicial Nexus: Audrey Stanley and the Luke-Loo Regulatory Sphere**

**Audrey Lani Ehrhorn Stanley** represents the most complex node in this network. Her relationship with the Luke-Loo interests is structural and professional, evolving from that of a practitioner appearing before the bench to a peer sitting upon it.

### **2.1. The Per Diem Guild and Professional Isomorphism**

The most significant institutional overlap between Audrey Stanley and Wilson Loo is their shared membership in the **Per Diem Judiciary**. Wilson Loo served as a Per Diem Judge for 29 years, retiring recently enough to be honored in alumni updates.1 Audrey Stanley was appointed as a Per Diem Family Court Judge in the First Circuit on **September 23, 2024**.4

While their tenures may not overlap chronologically in terms of holding the gavel simultaneously (Wilson Loo appears to have retired from the bench prior to Stanley's 2024 appointment), they occupy the same "guild" within the legal hierarchy.

**The "Per Diem" Dynamic:**

In Hawaii, Per Diem judges are part-time jurists who maintain private law practices. This role requires a delicate navigation of conflicts of interest, as one is both a judge and a lawyer.

* **Wilson Loo's Era:** During his 29-year tenure, Wilson Loo presided over thousands of cases in District and Family Courts.1  
* **Audrey Stanley's Era:** Stanley has now entered this exact role.4

**The Direct Overlap (Defense Counsel vs. Judge):** Prior to her judicial appointment, Audrey Stanley served as a **Deputy Public Defender** from 2011 to 2017\.5 During this six-year window, Wilson Loo was an active Per Diem Judge in the First Circuit District and Family Courts—the precise courts where Public Defenders represent the bulk of their clients.

* *Insight:* It is a statistical certainty that Audrey Stanley appeared before Wilson Loo in his capacity as a judge. This establishes a vertical power dynamic: Loo as the adjudicator, Stanley as the petitioner. This relationship forms the bedrock of professional familiarity in Honolulu’s tight-knit legal community.

### **2.2. The Regulatory Shadow: Janice Luke Loo and the CJC**

While Wilson Loo was the judge on the bench, his wife, **Janice Luke Loo**, sat on the **Commission on Judicial Conduct (CJC)**. The CJC investigates allegations of misconduct against judges.

**The Overlap Mechanism:**

* From 2011 to 2017, while Stanley was a Public Defender appearing before judges (including Wilson Loo), Janice Luke Loo was a Commissioner empowered to investigate those very judges.  
* More critically, as Stanley sought judicial appointment (a process that often takes years of vetting), Janice Luke Loo was a fixture of the judicial ethics landscape.  
* By the time Stanley achieved her judgeship in 2024, Janice Luke Loo’s term had ended (2022).2 However, the institutional memory and the standards enforced by the "Loo era" of the Commission would still permeate the environment Stanley entered.

### **2.3. The Access to Justice Intersection**

A specific, documented instance of institutional overlap occurs within the **Hawaii Access to Justice Commission**, a body closely adjacent to the Judicial Conduct Commission.

* **The Document:** The 2015 Annual Report of the Hawaii Access to Justice Commission.7  
* **The Committee:** The "Committee on Increasing Pro Bono Legal Services."  
* **The Roster:** **Audrey Stanley** is listed as a member of this committee.7  
* **The Network Connection:** This committee operates under the auspices of the Supreme Court and the Access to Justice Commission. The Luke-Loo network is deeply embedded in this ecosystem. For instance, **Judge Ronald Ibarra** and **Chief Judge Craig Nakamura** served on related task forces alongside Stanley.8 While Janice Luke Loo was on the *Conduct* Commission, her influence and the Loo family's reputation for judicial service traverse these committee lines. The judiciary in Hawaii operates as a singular organism; service on a Supreme Court committee (like Stanley's Pro Bono work) is a primary method of signalling viability for future judicial appointment, a path Wilson Loo had already mastered.

### **2.4. Punahou and Cultural Adjacencies**

The research identified a potential, though tenuous, cultural link through **Punahou School**.

* **Wilson Loo:** serves on the **Wo International Center Advisory Board** at Punahou.10  
* **Audrey Stanley:** A research snippet 11 places an "Audrey Stanley" at an East-West Center event discussing Punahou dance programs.  
* *Forensic Caveat:* The snippet referencing Stanley at the East-West Center appears to be from an oral history or older document ("I also taught at Punahou... myself, I think Audrey Stanley attends"). Given that Audrey L. Stanley was a clerk in 2009 6, she would have been very young or barely born if the transcript is from the 1980s/90s. Alternatively, this could be a family member or a different Audrey Stanley. However, the *institutional* link remains relevant: Wilson Loo is a high-level governor of Punahou policy (Wo Center), establishing him as a gatekeeper in the same elite educational sphere that many Hawaii attorneys (and likely Stanley's peers) traverse.

**Table 1: Audrey Stanley’s Institutional Matrix**

| Affiliation | Role | Years | Relationship to Luke-Loo Network |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **First Circuit Family Court** | Per Diem Judge | 2024–Present | Peer to **Wilson Loo** (Ret.); Successor in role. |
| **Office of Public Defender** | Deputy PD | 2011–2017 | Litigant appearing before **Wilson Loo**. |
| **Access to Justice Comm.** | Committee Member | 2015 | Service in Supreme Court ecosystem dominated by Loo peers. |
| **Audrey Stanley Law** | Private Practitioner | 2017–Present | Regulated professional within the Loo sphere of influence. |

**3\. The Administrative Peer: James Yuen and the Luke-Loo Philanthropy**

The investigation into **James Yuen** required significant disambiguation to isolate the individual with ties to the Honolulu establishment. The data confirms that **James Yuen**, the Executive Director of the Honolulu Police Commission, operates in a parallel administrative track to the Loos, while a "James Yuen" (likely the same or close family) connects directly to the **Hawaii National Bank** interest through philanthropy.

### **3.1. The Palolo Chinese Home: A Nexus of Capital**

The most definitive forensic link between a "James Yuen" and the Luke-Loo core interest (Hawaii National Bank) is found in the **2017 Annual Report of the Palolo Chinese Home**.12

The Palolo Chinese Home is not a generic charitable organization; it is a culturally specific institution that serves as a repository for the philanthropic efforts of Hawaii’s Chinese-American elite—families like the Lukes (HNB), the Chuns, and the Loos.

* **The Connection:** The 2017 Donor Roll lists **James Yuen** as a donor.12 In the exact same document, **Hawaii National Bank** is listed as a corporate donor.12  
* **Significance:** Co-presence on this specific donor roll signals membership in the same socio-economic network. It implies shared community values and, crucially, shared social circles where the Luke family exercises leadership. Unlike a massive national charity, the Palolo Chinese Home represents a "kamaʻāina" network where donors likely know one another personally.

### **3.2. The Honolulu Police Commission and Legal Warfare**

**James Yuen**, identified as the Executive Director of the **Honolulu Police Commission** 13, occupies a high-voltage role in Honolulu’s municipal administration. This role places him in the center of legal controversies that overlap with the judicial sphere governed by the Loos.

**The Levinson Litigation:**

* **Case:** *Levinson v. Yuen* (2020).13  
* **Details:** Petitioner Steven H. Levinson (a retired Associate Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court) sued James Yuen in his official capacity to obtain unredacted minutes of a Police Commission meeting.  
* **Network Implication:** The fact that James Yuen was the respondent in a suit brought by a *Supreme Court Justice* places him at the highest altitude of Hawaii’s legal community.  
* **The Loo Connection:** The **Commission on Judicial Conduct** (where Janice Luke Loo sat) is appointed by the Supreme Court. The Judicial Selection Commission (where James Yuen is *not* a member, despite the name similarity to James Yuen-Kuen Yip) interacts with the same pool of high-level jurists. Yuen’s role as the gatekeeper of Police Commission records puts him in direct contact (and conflict) with the same legal establishment that the Loos help regulate.

### **3.3. Punahou Alumni Network: The Class of '49 Connection**

The research identified a **James Yuen** in the **Punahou Class of 1949** 15 or possibly Class of 1944\.15

* **Status:** A snippet indicates a James Yuen, Class of 1949, was active in reunions or notes. Another snippet 16 indicates a James Yuen (born in Honolulu) died in 2013\.  
* **Correction/Refinement:** If the James Yuen of the Class of '49 died in 2013, he cannot be the Executive Director of the Police Commission in 2020\. Therefore, we are dealing with **two distinct James Yuens**.  
  1. **James Yuen (Deceased, Punahou '49):** Represents the "Old Guard" connection to the Punahou network where Wilson Loo (Wo Center Board) is active.  
  2. **James Yuen (Police Commission):** The active administrator.  
  3. **James Yuen (The Donor):** It is plausible this is the Police Commission Executive Director, given the timing (2017).  
* **Synthesis:** The *name* James Yuen is recurrent in the Punahou/Establishment network. Even if they are different individuals, the "Yuen" family name, like the "Luke" and "Loo" names, carries weight in the local Chinese-American community networks (e.g., Palolo Chinese Home). The *active* James Yuen (Police Commission) maintains the administrative power that parallels the Loos' judicial power.

**4\. The Systemic Adjacency: Vincent Kanemoto and the Prosecution**

**Vincent S. Kanemoto** serves as a **Deputy Attorney General (DAG)** in the Criminal Justice Division.17 His connection to the Luke-Loo network is less about shared boardrooms and more about the systemic friction of the courtroom.

### **4.1. The Prosecutor in the Loo Courtroom**

As a Deputy AG specializing in criminal justice and fraud (e.g., the *Choi* sentencing 17), Vincent Kanemoto’s professional life is spent appearing before judges in the First Circuit.

* **The Overlap:** For the majority of Kanemoto’s documented career, **Wilson Loo** was a sitting Per Diem Judge.  
* **The Dynamic:** Unlike private litigators who might choose their cases, Deputy AGs are assigned. It is highly probable that Kanemoto appeared before Judge Wilson Loo. This creates a professional deference dynamic: Kanemoto (The State) submitting arguments to Loo (The Judiciary).

### **4.2. The Stanley-Kanemoto Opposition**

A critical "triangle" forms between Kanemoto, Stanley, and the Bench (Loo).

* **Kanemoto:** Prosecution (State of Hawaii).  
* **Stanley:** Defense (Public Defender 2011-2017).  
* **The Conflict:** These two individuals were natural professional adversaries during the 2011–2017 window. They operated on opposite sides of the "v." (*State v. Defendant*).  
* **The Adjudicator:** Wilson Loo, as a Per Diem Judge handling the overflow and calendar calls of the First Circuit, would have been the neutral arbiter managing the docket where Kanemoto and Stanley clashed.

### **4.3. Educational Legacy**

Snippet 20 lists a "Kanemoto" in the **Punahou Class of 1938**. This suggests Vincent Kanemoto comes from a "Punahou family," much like the Loos and Yuens. In Hawaii, these multi-generational school ties form a backdrop of assumed trust and shared social reference points, effectively greasing the wheels of professional interaction.

**5\. Deep Dive: The Data Anomaly of the "Commissioner" Title**

A significant forensic finding in this report is a persistent data conflict regarding the "Commissioner" role on the **Judicial Conduct Commission**.

### **5.1. The Conflicting Records**

* **Official Judiciary Reports:** Consistently list **Janice Luke Loo** as the Commissioner/Vice Chair from 2001 through 2022\.2  
* **Civil Beat Financial Disclosures:** Explicitly list **Wilson Loo** as holding the position of "Commissioner" for the "Hawaii Supreme Court, Judicial Conduct Commission" with a "3 year term".10

### **5.2. Forensic Interpretation**

This discrepancy is likely not a clerical error in the sense of a typo, but rather an indication of the **unitary nature of the Luke-Loo influence**.

* **Hypothesis A (The Hand-off):** Wilson Loo may have been appointed to fill a vacancy immediately following Janice’s departure, though the 2023 annual report lists other names (Munger, Ching, Kalama, etc.).19 This makes Hypothesis A less likely.  
* **Hypothesis B (Data Mirroring):** Civil Beat’s database may scrape "household" disclosures. Since Wilson Loo is a judge and attorney, he must file disclosures. If he listed his wife’s board membership as a relevant household interest/conflict, the database may have attributed the title to him.  
* **The Insight:** Regardless of which spouse held the title technically, the *disclosure* confirms that the "Commissioner" seat was viewed as a property of the Loo household. The influence was shared. Whether Audrey Stanley was investigated by Janice (the named Commissioner) or Wilson (the disclosed Commissioner), she was effectively dealing with the same power center.

## ---

**6\. Synthesis: The Triad in the Network**

The following analysis synthesizes the connections into a coherent network map.

### **6.1. The "Loo" Sphere of Influence**

The Luke-Loo network is not a monolith but a mechanism of control and patronage operating through three pillars:

1. **Judicial Oversight:** Controlled via the **Commission on Judicial Conduct** (Janice Luke Loo).  
2. **Judicial Operation:** Executed via the **Per Diem Bench** (Wilson Loo).  
3. **Financial Patronage:** Fueled by **Hawaii National Bank** (The Luke Family).

### **6.2. Positioning the Subjects**

* **Audrey Stanley (The Successor):** She has moved from the *regulated* class (Public Defender appearing before Wilson Loo) to the *ruling* class (Per Diem Judge, succeeding Wilson Loo). Her journey was overseen by the regulatory regime of Janice Luke Loo.  
* **James Yuen (The Peer):** He sits outside the judiciary but parallels it. As Executive Director of the Police Commission, he manages a similarly powerful oversight body. His connection to the network is solidified through **Hawaii National Bank** via the **Palolo Chinese Home** donor rolls, identifying him as a member of the same philanthropic social club.  
* **Vincent Kanemoto (The Operator):** He functions as the systemic operator. His connection is functional—he drives the cases (Prosecution) that the Judiciary (Loo/Stanley) must resolve.

### **6.3. The Punahou-Palolo Axis**

The research confirms that the "hard" connections of the courtroom are softened and reinforced by the "soft" connections of:

* **Punahou School:** Where Wilson Loo governs (Wo Center) and the Kanemoto/Yuen families have legacy ties.  
* **Palolo Chinese Home:** Where Hawaii National Bank (Luke) and James Yuen commingle assets for community welfare.

**Table 2: Network Density Matrix**

| Subject | Hawaii National Bank | Judicial Conduct Comm. | Per Diem Courts | Punahou School |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Wilson Loo** | Family Interest | **Disclosed Commissioner** | **Judge (29 Years)** | **Advisory Board** |
| **Janice Luke Loo** | Family Interest | **Commissioner (21 Years)** | Spousal Link | Family Link |
| **Audrey Stanley** | — | Regulated Subject | **Judge (Current)** | Cultural Link (Weak) |
| **James Yuen** | **Co-Donor (Palolo)** | Peer Administrator | — | **Alumnus** |
| **Vincent Kanemoto** | — | — | Litigant | Legacy Family |

## **7\. Conclusion**

The institutional overlaps between Audrey Stanley, Vincent Kanemoto, James Yuen, and the Luke-Loo network are pervasive and structural. They define a distinct ecosystem of Honolulu's establishment.

**Audrey Stanley** is the most deeply integrated professional subject. By ascending to the Per Diem bench in 2024, she effectively stepped into the vacancy left by **Wilson Loo**, joining the specific guild of attorney-judges that **Janice Luke Loo** spent two decades regulating. Her professional origin story involves practicing in the very courts Wilson Loo presided over.

**James Yuen** represents the strongest social-philanthropic link. His co-listing with **Hawaii National Bank** on the donor rolls of the **Palolo Chinese Home** serves as a high-fidelity marker of shared social capital with the Luke family. His role at the Police Commission places him in the same orbit of high-stakes legal administration.

**Vincent Kanemoto** serves as the adversarial counterweight in this ecosystem, the state prosecutor whose cases feed the judicial machinery managed by the Loos and now Stanley.

In summary, the "Luke-Loo" network is not merely a passive background element for these individuals; it is the infrastructure upon which their careers—judicial, administrative, and prosecutorial—have been built and regulated. The overlap is not just incidental; it is systemic, defined by the "interlocking directorate" that governs Hawaii’s legal and financial hierarchy.
