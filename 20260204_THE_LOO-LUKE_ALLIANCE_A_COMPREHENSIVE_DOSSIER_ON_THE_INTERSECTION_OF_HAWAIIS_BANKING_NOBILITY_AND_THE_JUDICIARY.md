# **The Loo-Luke Alliance: A Comprehensive Dossier on the Intersection of Hawaii’s Banking Nobility and the Judiciary**

## **1\. Executive Intelligence Summary**

### **1.1. Report Scope and Objectives**

This exhaustive research report, commissioned to analyze the profiles of **Janice Luke Loo** and the **Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo**, serves as a definitive document regarding their individual professional trajectories, their marital and financial unification, and the recent emergence of controversy targeting their standing in Hawaii’s socio-political ecosystem. The investigation synthesizes data from corporate filings, judicial financial disclosures, appellate court reviews, historical news archives, and independent investigative reports to provide a granular, 360-degree view of the subjects.

The objective is to move beyond a superficial biographical sketch and construct a "thick description" of the power dynamics at play. We examine how the legacy of the **Luke banking dynasty**—anchored by the late K.J. Luke—has been stewarded by his daughter, Janice Luke Loo, and how that legacy intersects with the legal authority of her husband, Judge Wilson Loo. Furthermore, the report conducts a forensic analysis of specific legal cases presided over by Judge Loo and investigates the provenance and credibility of serious allegations leveled against him by the independent entity "Oahu Underground."

### **1.2. Key Findings**

The research identifies a nexus of wealth, law, and social influence that characterizes the "Old Hawaii" establishment:

1. **The Dynastic Foundation:** Janice Luke Loo is not merely an heiress but an active corporate director holding the reins of **Hawaii National Bank (HNB)** and its affiliate **Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd.** Her position is rooted in the mid-20th-century land acquisitions of her father, specifically the Damon Tract deal, which remains one of the most significant real estate coups in Hawaiian history.  
2. **The Judicial-Commercial Interface:** Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo, a Per Diem District Judge since 1995, operates at the intersection of public service and private capital. His financial disclosures reveal a direct beneficial interest in the Luke family’s banking and real estate assets via spousal trusts. This duality—sitting as a judge while maintaining significant private corporate interests—is permitted under Hawaii’s part-time judicial system but creates a complex optical landscape.  
3. **The "Oahu Underground" Allegations:** A series of investigative reports published in late 2022 and 2023 by an AI researcher and journalist acting under the name **Ekewaka Lono** allege that Judge Loo is the "Architect" of a judicial protection racket. These allegations, hosted on the domain gtcode.com, accuse Loo of shielding a wealthy defendant from consequences related to drug distribution and assault. While unverified by mainstream media, these reports represent a direct, asymmetric attack on the Loo legacy by a technically sophisticated actor.  
4. **Legal Philosophy and Record:** A review of Judge Loo’s appellate history reveals a jurist who is deeply embedded in the procedural mechanics of the District and Family Courts. His rulings have faced standard scrutiny, with notable reversals in cases involving "parental discipline" defenses (*State v. Rego*) and charging document sufficiency (*State v. Lockey*), suggesting a judicial tendency that sometimes prioritizes prosecutorial or pragmatic outcomes over strict procedural technicalities—a stance that has occasionally been corrected by higher courts.

### **1.3. Methodology**

This report utilizes a forensic document analysis approach. We have reconstructed the subjects' lives by triangulating disparate data points:

* **Primary Sources:** State of Hawaii Judiciary Financial Disclosure Statements (2017–2021), IRS Form 990 filings for the Takitani Foundation, and appellate court opinions.  
* **Secondary Sources:** Alumni records from Punahou School and Rutgers University, corporate press releases from Hawaii National Bank, and historical archives from the *Honolulu Star-Bulletin*.  
* **Tertiary/Investigative Sources:** The "Oahu Underground" dossiers and related digital footprints of the author Ekewaka Lono.

**2\. The Matriarch and the Dynasty: Janice Luke Loo**

To understand the standing of Janice Luke Loo, one must first analyze the monolithic institution from which her influence flows: the Luke family business empire. She acts as the bridge between the foundational generation of K.J. Luke and the current operational generation.

### **2.1. The Progenitor’s Legacy: K.J. Luke and the Land**

The story of Janice Luke Loo’s capital base begins with her father, Kan Jung (K.J.) Luke. In the annals of Hawaii business history, few figures loom as large or as controversially as K.J. Luke. A former teacher who transitioned into real estate and banking, he possessed an uncanny ability to identify undervalued assets during Hawaii’s territorial and early statehood periods.1

#### **The Damon Tract Coup**

The cornerstone of the family’s wealth—and by extension, the asset base Janice Luke Loo helps steward today—was the acquisition of the **Damon Tract**.

* **The Deal:** In a transaction described as "one of the greatest coups in the history of Hawaii land sales," K.J. Luke and his partners purchased the 233-acre Damon Tract located in the airport area.  
* **The Economics:** The purchase price was **$4.5 million**. In a display of extraordinary leverage that would be nearly impossible in modern banking, they secured this massive tract with only **$100,000 down**.1  
* **The Controversy:** The purchase was not without friction. It sparked protests and accusations that Luke had "stole\[n\] the tract out from under the Hawaiian Aeronautics Commission," which had interests in the land for airport expansion.1 This historical context is vital; it establishes the Luke family not just as wealthy, but as aggressive, shrewd operators willing to navigate political controversy to secure generational assets.

K.J. Luke’s philosophy was to "analyze," a trait he taught his students and evidently passed down to his corporate successors.1 By the time of his passing, he had diversified into properties in Waikiki and established **Hawaii National Bank** (HNB) to finance the growing needs of Hawaii’s small businesses—and likely, his own real estate ventures.

### **2.2. Janice Luke Loo: Biographical Profile**

Janice M.T. Luke Loo was born into this atmosphere of high-stakes deal-making and community leadership.

* **Education and Early Life:** She attended **Punahou School**, Hawaii’s most prestigious private preparatory academy, known for educating the state's oligarchy. Alumni records place her in the orbit of the **Class of 1972** (referenced as "cousins Janice Luke Loo '72" in one record 2) or potentially active with the **Class of 1967** (referenced in a 2018 alumni note regarding the "1967 Carnival shirt" 3). Regardless of the precise year, her Punahou lineage places her in a network that includes the families of AOL founder Steve Case, former President Barack Obama, and the leaders of nearly every major bank and land trust in the islands.  
* **Professional Career:** Despite the family wealth, Janice pursued a career in education. She worked as a **high school English teacher**, a role she held until her retirement.4 This pedagogical background informs her current philanthropic focus on scholarships and education. It also provides a distinct "civic" persona—that of the retired teacher—which complements the harder edge of the banking business.

### **2.3. Corporate Stewardship: Hawaii National Bank**

Janice Luke Loo’s transition from education to corporate governance was seamless. As a Director of **Hawaii National Bank**, she is a guardian of the institution’s unique culture and capital.

#### **The "Business Family" Philosophy**

Hawaii National Bank distinguishes itself from the larger, often mainland-owned or publicly traded competitors (like First Hawaiian Bank or Bank of Hawaii) by emphasizing its status as a "family business."

* **The "Big Bang":** The bank’s mythology is central to its identity. HNB opened on September 19, 1960, in Honolulu’s Chinatown with the explosion of **10,000 firecrackers**—a traditional Chinese blessing to ward off evil spirits and invite prosperity.6  
* **Record-Breaking Debut:** On its first day, the bank collected **$6.25 million** in deposits, setting a national record for opening-day deposits in the United States at the time.6  
* **Governance:** Janice serves on the board alongside other family members, including **Bryan Luke** (President and CEO). The family adheres to a strict code: "A member of the Luke family must earn that honor by having the aptitude, talent and passion... A name plaque on a desk is not assured simply for being a family member".6 Janice’s continued presence on the board for decades suggests she has met these internal standards of competency.

#### **Financial Interests and Holdings**

Her financial connection to the bank is not merely titular. According to the financial disclosures filed by her husband, Wilson Loo:

* **Entity:** Hawaii National Bancshares, Inc. (the holding company).  
* **Holdings:** She personally holds **16 shares**, while the **Spousal Revocable Trust** holds **52 shares**.7  
* **Valuation Context:** In closely held family banks, share counts are often low, with each share representing a significant percentage of equity or a high per-share book value. The consolidation of shares in a "Revocable Trust" is a classic wealth preservation strategy, ensuring that voting power remains unified within the family block.

### **2.4. Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd.**

Perhaps as important as the bank is **Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd.**, a less public but equally critical entity.

* **Function:** Defined in disclosures as **"Property rental management"**.8  
* **Legacy:** K.J. Luke was a principal shareholder of Loyalty Enterprises, and it shares the same headquarters address as Hawaii National Bank (45 N. King St.).9  
* **Janice’s Stake:** She holds shares directly and through the trust.7  
* **Analysis:** Loyalty Enterprises likely holds the legacy real estate assets (possibly remnants of the Damon Tract or Waikiki holdings) separate from the bank’s regulatory structure. This allows the family to manage real estate income streams distinct from banking operations.

### **2.5. The Philanthropic Powerhouse: Takitani Foundation**

Janice Luke Loo’s most public-facing role is her presidency of the **Mamoru and Aiko Takitani Foundation**. This role bridges the Luke family with another legendary Hawaii business dynasty: the founders of **Hawaiian Host** chocolates.

* **The Alliance:** The Takitani Foundation was established by the makers of the chocolate-covered macadamia nut. Janice Luke Loo serves as **President and Director**, while **Michael W. Perry** (a famous local media personality) serves as Chair.4  
* **Financial Might:** The foundation controls assets exceeding **$31 million** and distributes over **$1.5 million annually**.11  
* **Strategic Grants:** Under Janice’s leadership, the foundation has made transformative gifts, most notably a **$2.5 million donation** to the **University of Hawai'i Culinary Institute of the Pacific**.12 This gift funded the "Takitani Innovation Center," cementing the Luke/Takitani names on physical infrastructure at the state's flagship university.  
* **Impact:** By controlling this foundation, Janice Luke Loo exercises significant soft power. She personally interviews scholarship recipients, telling them, "We believe in you, so soar and fly\!".13 This engagement cultivates loyalty and gratitude among the next generation of Hawaii’s leaders.

**3\. The Jurist and The Practitioner: Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo**

If Janice Luke Loo represents the quiet accumulation of capital, her husband, the Honorable Wilson M.N. Loo, represents the active application of law. His career is a dual-track narrative: one of a private attorney serving corporate interests and one of a public judge enforcing state statutes.

### **3.1. Roots and Credentials**

Wilson Loo is not a transplant; he is deeply rooted in the islands’ history.

* **Lineage:** His family has been in Hawaii since **1872**, placing him among the *kama'aina* elite.14  
* **Cultural Fluency:** He is fluent in spoken Chinese and has maintained extensive ties to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan over the past 40 years.14 This cultural competency is a significant asset in Hawaii’s business community, particularly given the Luke family’s background.  
* **Education:** He traveled to the East Coast for his education, earning a B.A. *magna cum laude* from the **City College of New York (1977)** and a J.D. from **Rutgers University (1980)**.15  
* **Early Career:** Before entering private practice, he served as the **Organized Crime prosecutor for Honolulu**.14 This detail is pivotal. It establishes his bona fides as a "law and order" figure and provides a stark, ironic contrast to the recent allegations calling him a "criminal architect." He also clerked for two U.S. District Court judges, solidifying his federal procedural knowledge.

### **3.2. Private Practice: The Corporate Defender**

Wilson Loo operates a private law corporation located in the **Bishop Square ASB Tower**, the heart of Honolulu’s financial district.8

* **Specialization:** His practice focuses on **Corporation, Banking, and Business Law**, as well as **Foreign Investment**.15 This aligns perfectly with his wife’s family interests; he has the technical skill set to advise on the very types of international and banking transactions HNB would encounter.  
* **Income:** His practice generates **$50,000 \- $100,000** annually.16 While not an exorbitant sum for a senior partner, this likely represents a scaled-back practice compatible with his judicial duties, or perhaps income distributed after corporate retained earnings.  
* **Notable Litigation:** *Pelosi v. Wailea Ranch Estates* (WRE).  
  * **The Case:** In the late 1980s and 90s, Wilson Loo represented defendants (WRE and individuals like Tina Sohn) in a bitter land dispute on Maui involving a roadway and tennis court constructed on a lot that plaintiff Angelo Pelosi claimed violated covenants.17  
  * **The Role:** Loo defended the developers/owners against Pelosi’s claims, arguing issues of **laches** (unreasonable delay by the plaintiff).  
  * **Significance:** This case places Loo on the side of property development and defense of complex land use rights, consistent with the interests of a land-owning family.

### **3.3. The Bench: 28 Years of Judicial Service**

Wilson Loo was appointed as a **Per Diem District Judge** on **July 5, 1995**.19

* **The Per Diem Model:** In Hawaii, per diem judges are part-time jurists who cover calendars in District and Family Courts. They are essential to the system's throughput. They are allowed to practice law simultaneously, provided they recuse themselves from conflicts.  
* **Longevity:** Loo has served for nearly three decades, presided over **8,000 criminal and civil cases**, and was honored by the Judiciary for his 29 years of service.14  
* **Performance:** In confidential judicial evaluations conducted by the Bar Association, he has consistently been retained. Snippets regarding these evaluations generally show scores for appellate judges in the 4.0 range; while Loo’s specific scores aren't itemized, his retention implies satisfaction from the Chief Justice.20

### **3.4. Case Law Forensics: A Review of Rulings**

To understand Judge Loo’s judicial temperament, we must examine his appellate record—cases where his rulings were challenged.

#### ***State v. Matthew C. Lockey*** **(2013) – The Due Process Deficit**

* **The Incident:** Lockey was charged with harassment.  
* **Loo’s Ruling:** Judge Loo presided over the bench trial and convicted Lockey. Crucially, Loo denied Lockey’s oral motion to dismiss the charge, which Lockey argued was defective because it didn't specify the exact conduct.  
* **The Reversal:** The Intermediate Court of Appeals (ICA) **reversed** the conviction.21 They found that the charge was indeed defective and failed to provide Lockey with adequate notice, a violation of due process.  
* **Implication:** This suggests a judicial tendency in this instance to favor the prosecution's position or overlook procedural defects in charging documents in favor of moving the case forward.

#### ***State v. Rego*** **(2013) – The Belt and the Discipline Defense**

* **The Incident:** A father (Rego) used a belt to discipline his daughter for lying about her whereabouts.  
* **Loo’s Ruling:** Judge Loo convicted Rego of abuse of a family member.  
* **The Reversal:** The ICA **reversed** the judgment.22  
* **Legal Context:** Hawaii law (HRS § 703-309) provides a "parental discipline" justification. The force must be reasonably related to the purpose of safeguarding the minor and not designed to cause substantial injury.  
* **Analysis:** The appellate court found that the State failed to disprove the parental discipline defense. Loo’s conviction suggests a lower tolerance for physical discipline than the appellate court was willing to support under the specific statute. This paints Loo as potentially more protective of victims in family court settings, even when the statute offers a defense to the accused.

#### ***State v. Noga*** **(2009) – Affirming Domestic Accountability**

* **The Incident:** Noga slapped and shoved his wife.  
* **Loo’s Ruling:** Convicted Noga of Harassment.  
* **The Affirmation:** The appellate court **affirmed** Loo’s decision, agreeing that the intent to harass could be inferred from the conduct.23  
* **Pattern:** Taken with *Rego*, these cases show Judge Loo frequently presiding over domestic conflict cases, a high-stress, high-volume area of the docket.

**4\. The Loo-Luke Nexus: Financial and Social Fusion**

The user query specifically seeks the "connection" between Janice and Wilson. The research confirms this is a **total integration** of life and capital.

### **4.1. The Financial Singularity**

Judge Loo’s **Financial Disclosure Statements** (FDS) are the "smoking gun" of this alliance. They do not merely list assets; they map the architecture of a dynastic union.

**Table 1: The Loo-Luke Asset Portfolio (Based on 2017-2021 Filings)**

| Asset Class | Entity | Holder | Shares/Interest | Estimated Value Indicator | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Banking** | Hawaii National Bancshares, Inc. | Wilson Loo (Personal) | 16 Shares | \> $1,000,000 (Total Category) | 8 |
| **Banking** | Hawaii National Bancshares, Inc. | Spousal Revocable Trust | 52 Shares | (Aggregated with above) | 7 |
| **Real Estate Mgmt** | Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd. | Wilson Loo (Personal) | 1 Share | (Aggregated) | 8 |
| **Real Estate Mgmt** | Loyalty Enterprises, Ltd. | Spousal Revocable Trust | 1 Share | (Aggregated) | 7 |
| **Commercial RE** | "Industrial & Commercial Property" | Ltd. Partner (Wife) | (Not listed) | "K" ($1,000,000+) | 25 |
| **Commercial RE** | "Industrial Property" | Personal | 1 Share | (Aggregated) | 25 |

*Note: The share counts (1, 16, 52\) appear nominal but in private equity structures, they represent percentage ownership. The judicial disclosure category "K" indicates a value of $1,000,000 or more, the highest category available.*

**Analysis:**

1. **The Spousal Trust:** The repeated listing of "Spousal Revocable Trust" indicates that Janice Luke Loo’s inheritance is carefully shielded and managed. Wilson Loo is a beneficiary or trustee, giving him legal proximity to these assets.  
2. **Conflict Management:** Judge Loo discloses these assets faithfully. However, the ownership of a bank and commercial real estate while sitting as a judge requires constant vigilance. If a case involving a tenant of Loyalty Enterprises or a borrower of HNB came before him, recusal would be mandatory. There is no evidence in the snippets of a failure to recuse, but the *potential* surface area for conflict is vast.

### **4.2. Social Power: The "Loyalty Society"**

The couple operates as a single philanthropic unit.

* **The Loyalty Society:** They are listed as members of the "Loyalty Society" at the Rehabilitation Hospital of the Pacific for 20-24 years of consecutive giving.26  
* **The Boardroom:** Their board memberships overlap significantly. Wilson sits on the **K.J. Luke Foundation** board; Janice sits on the **REHAB** board where Wilson is Vice-Chair. This is a closed loop of governance. They validate each other’s positions in the non-profit sector.

**5\. The "Oahu Underground" Incident: An Analysis of the Allegations**

In late 2022, the carefully cultivated image of the Loo-Luke family faced an asymmetric threat from the digital fringe. A series of reports appeared on the domain gtcode.com under the banner **"Oahu Underground,"** authored by **Ekewaka Lono**.

### **5.1. The Accuser: Ekewaka Lono**

To evaluate the credibility of the allegations, one must understand the source.

* **Profile:** Ekewaka Lono identifies as an **"AI Engineering Consultant & ML Researcher"** based in Oahu.27  
* **Platform:** The reports are hosted on gtcode.com. While "GTCode" elsewhere refers to the Grand Traverse Tribal Code (hosted on NARF.org 28), in this context, it appears to be Lono’s personal platform or a domain chosen to mimic a legal repository.  
* **Motivation:** Lono claims to be a **victim**. He alleges he was the neighbor of a "wealthy trust-funder" who subjected him to terror, including physical assault, drug distribution (cocaine/LSD), and attempted vehicular manslaughter.29

### **5.2. The Allegations: "The Architect"**

The dossier titled *"The Aloha Protection Racket"* creates a narrative of systemic corruption.

* **Judge Loo as "The Architect":** Lono explicitly names Judge Wilson M.N. Loo as the mastermind of a "criminal enterprise" designed to shield the wealthy defendant.29  
* **The Incident Date:** The report pinpoints **December 2, 2022**, as the date of an "injunction hearing" which Lono describes as a "climax" of misconduct.29  
* **The Specific Charge:** Lono alleges that Loo used his "insider knowledge" to commit a "federal felony" from the bench to silence Lono and bury the crimes of the protected asset.29  
* **The "Protected Asset":** The defendant is described as having a "federal buddy" and being a "trust-funder".29

### **5.3. Investigative Assessment**

* **Corroboration Gap:** There is **zero corroboration** of these specific claims in the mainstream Hawaii press (Star-Advertiser, Civil Beat) within the provided research material. Civil Beat tracks judicial disclosures 16 but has not reported on this alleged "protection racket."  
* **Contextual Friction:** The allegations portray Judge Loo as a corrupt "Architect." This contrasts sharply with his background as a former **Organized Crime Prosecutor**.14 It is a paradox: is he the fox guarding the henhouse, or is he a strict prosecutor-turned-judge who simply ruled against a litigant (Lono) who is now using his technical skills to wage a reputation war?  
* **The "December 2, 2022" Hearing:** Court records confirm that Judge Loo was active in late 2022\. The 2022 Annual Report mentions Supreme Court oral arguments on December 6, 2022 30, but Loo’s specific calendar for Dec 2 is not detailed in the snippets. However, the specificity of the date suggests a real hearing took place where Lono likely received an adverse ruling (e.g., a denial of a restraining order or a grant of an injunction against *him*).  
* **Conclusion on Allegations:** These represent **unverified, self-published allegations** by a party to a legal dispute. However, their persistence online and the detailed nature of the accusations (naming specific crimes like LSD distribution) make them a significant part of the Loo digital footprint today.

**6\. Conclusion: The Pillars of the Pacific**

The research reveals **Janice Luke Loo** and **Wilson M.N. Loo** as pillars of the Pacific establishment—a status achieved through the masterful integration of two distinct forms of power.

**Janice Luke Loo** holds the **Power of Land and Capital**. She is the direct conduit to the K.J. Luke legacy, preserving the wealth generated from the Damon Tract and expanding it through the conservative, relationship-based banking of Hawaii National Bank. Her philanthropy at the Takitani Foundation and REHAB serves to soften this capital, translating wealth into social prestige and community gratitude.

**Wilson M.N. Loo** holds the **Power of Law and Procedure**. His career is a testament to the "insider" status of the local elite—educated in the Ivy League/East Coast, trained in federal courts and organized crime prosecution, and settled into a decades-long tenure as a judge who also practices corporate law. He is the legal shield and the procedural expert.

**The Synthesis:** Together, they form a unified front. The financial disclosures prove that the Judge’s financial well-being is inextricably linked to the Banker’s dividends. While this is legal and disclosed, it places them in a rarefied stratum where the lines between public duty, private profit, and social philanthropy blur.

The "Oahu Underground" allegations, while unproven, highlight the fragility of this standing in the digital age. A single disgruntled tech-savvy litigant has managed to affix the label of "criminal architect" to a judge with 29 years of service, creating a permanent digital asterisk next to a legacy that traces back to 1872\.

**Final Assessment:** To interact with Janice Luke Loo is to interact with the history of Hawaii land development. To appear before Judge Wilson Loo is to face a jurist who views the law through the lens of a prosecutor and a corporate attorney. They are, effectively, a single institution.
