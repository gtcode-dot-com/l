**Re:** **Updated / Superseding Request for Federal Review and Record Preservation** — Alleged suborning of perjury, obstruction of justice, deprivation of rights under color of law, and witness tampering arising from (i) a sealed First Circuit proceeding on **December 2, 2022** and (ii) a prior First Circuit criminal case (**c. 2015–2017**) in which I was the defendant; **ODC complaint packet enclosed**.

## I. Preliminary Statement (why this resubmission exists)

This filing **supersedes** my prior complaint dated **July 12, 2025** (receipt previously acknowledged). I submit this updated version for one reason: to present a **conservative, verifiable, records-first** account of events that—if confirmed by court records—implicate discrete federal criminal statutes and merit federal preservation and review.

I am not asking the Department to adopt my conclusions. I am asking the Department to do what state mechanisms have declined or procedurally avoided: **pull the record**, evaluate whether the elements are met, and determine whether inquiry is warranted.

This submission also encloses a contemporaneous **Office of Disciplinary Counsel (“ODC”) packet** filed [DATE] (three attorney conduct complaints arising from the earlier criminal case). Those materials are included not to “federalize” attorney discipline, but because they supply a structured account of (a) threatened witness testimony and (b) the suppression of material contextual evidence that bears directly on the **witness-tampering** issue and on the broader pattern of institutional failure.

---

## II. Executive Summary (intake-ready)

This matter presents two tightly bounded clusters:

### A. **December 2, 2022 (First Circuit; in-person; audio-only; sealed)**

I allege that during sworn testimony, the presiding judge **visibly signaled** a witness to deny furnishing LSD to me; when I attempted to state this on the record, the judge **cut me off** before my objection could be captured on the audio record; the matter was then sealed; and the sealed record contains an **out-of-turn false allegation of child sexual abuse** (“Defamation A”) that the court did not strike and did not permit me to rebut before sealing.

If corroborated by the sealed audio, minute entries, and exhibits, these facts may implicate:

* **18 U.S.C. § 1622** (suborning perjury),
* **18 U.S.C. § 1503** (obstruction of justice), and
* **18 U.S.C. § 242** (deprivation of rights under color of law, including due process impairment through directed false testimony, suppression of objection, and sealing of an unrebutted stigmatizing allegation).

### B. **2015–2017 (First Circuit criminal matter; hung jury)**

During the pendency of that prosecution, I was subjected to a **credible in-person murder threat** by named individuals; I reported that threat to counsel; and shortly before trial I was threatened by a private actor (“Kevin,” surname known to me) in a manner designed to prevent me from testifying about the murder threat at the upcoming trial—conduct that may constitute **witness tampering** under **18 U.S.C. § 1512**.

### Structural fact relevant to triage

The earlier public defender who dismissed my first report of the murder threat (Audrey L.E. Stanley) has since been appointed as a per diem judge in the First Circuit, **replacing** the judge whose 2022 conduct is at issue (Wilson M.N. Loo)—**same bench, same complainant, successive officials**, each the subject of formal complaints arising from conduct toward me.

---

## III. Persons Involved (for identification)

### State officials / officers of the court

* **Judge Wilson M.N. Loo** — First Circuit (per diem), presiding judge, December 2, 2022 (sealed matter).
* **Audrey L.E. Stanley** — then public defender during the earlier criminal matter; now per diem judge in the First Circuit, **replacing Judge Loo on the same bench** (to my understanding).
* **Vincent Kanemoto** — prosecutor in the earlier criminal matter (trial c. 2017).
* **Marcus Landsberg** — private defense counsel in the earlier criminal matter.
* **Honolulu Police Department (HPD)** — multiple reports filed regarding McKinley’s alleged conduct; repeated non-investigation.

### Private parties

* **Jason Dean McKinley** — witness/opposing party in the December 2, 2022 proceeding.
* **Eugene (“Gene”) Hartmann and Rita Hartmann** — alleged deliverers of the murder threat during the earlier criminal matter.
* **“Kevin” (surname known to me)** — alleged witness-tampering actor outside Kahala Whole Foods (May/June 2017).

## IV. Factual Statement — December 2, 2022 sealed proceeding

### A. Context

I appeared **pro se** in an in-person First Circuit injunction hearing on **December 2, 2022** in Honolulu. The proceeding was recorded as **audio-only** and later **sealed**.

McKinley’s reported conduct toward me included physical assault, a separate incident in which he accelerated his stick-shift vehicle at high speed toward me as I walked away on the opposite side of the road (I did not see it coming until I turned my head, saw his face, and he veered off at the last moment, narrowly missing me), stalking/harassment, and furnishing of LSD (a Schedule I controlled substance) at Stonefish Grill in Haleʻiwa (CCTV location known). I filed reports with HPD and made contacts with HPD Narcotics/Vice and the DEA. HPD declined to investigate. I pursued the injunction proceeding because ordinary channels had not addressed the conduct.

### B. What I personally observed (the core event sequence)

1. McKinley was sworn and testified.
2. I asked under oath whether he **furnished LSD** to me.
3. A text-message exhibit in the court file contained my message to McKinley: **“I took the acid.”** I sent that message. **Reasonable minds may differ on the exhibit's ultimate import, but the inconsistency between the filed exhibit and the sworn denial is material.** The text supports my account that McKinley furnished LSD to me (i.e., I took possession from him) and is evidence of his conduct, not mine.
4. Immediately before the witness’s denial, I observed the presiding judge make a visible “no” signal toward the witness (a head gesture).
5. The witness denied furnishing LSD.
6. I attempted to place the judge’s signal on the record by stating: **“Let the record show that the judge just—”**
7. The judge **interrupted and cut me off** before I could complete the sentence, preventing my objection from being captured on the audio record.
8. Before the case was sealed, McKinley uttered out of turn—outside questioning—**a false allegation of child sexual abuse** (“Defamation A”). Judge Loo did not strike it and did not permit me to respond. The matter was then sealed, placing an unrebutted stigmatizing allegation inside an official record accessible to persons with judicial access while foreclosing public rebuttal by me.

### C. Federal relevance (why this is not merely a “bad hearing”)

If the sealed audio, exhibits, and minute entries corroborate the above, the Department can evaluate whether the conduct satisfies the elements of:

* **18 U.S.C. § 1622** (if the judge’s signal procured false testimony),
* **18 U.S.C. § 1503** (if the interruption prevented creation of a record of misconduct), and
* **18 U.S.C. § 242** (if due process rights were impaired under color of law through directed false testimony, suppression of objection, and sealing of an unrebutted stigmatizing allegation).

### D. Systemic disclosure implications (Brady / Giglio)

If the sealed audio corroborates that Judge Loo signaled a witness to deny a material fact under oath, that conduct is a prior act bearing on judicial truthfulness that may trigger disclosure obligations under **Brady v. Maryland** and **Giglio v. United States** in other cases Judge Loo adjudicated. This creates institutional risk beyond my individual case: convictions or judgments from those matters could be vulnerable to collateral attack if the record reflects directed false testimony in a sealed proceeding. I raise this not as a demand or separate notification, but as a reason the Department should prioritize a narrow review of the sealed record to assess systemic exposure. A focused review would allow the Department to determine whether any remedial disclosure steps are warranted.

## V. Factual Statement — 2015–2017 prior criminal matter and witness tampering

### A. The earlier proceeding (minimal necessary background)

In *State of Hawaiʻi v. Lowndes* (First Circuit; approx. 2015–2017), I was charged with **Violent Interference with a Tax Official** (**“VIWATO”**). The case number is not available to me; the record has been sealed or expunged and I no longer possess the case number. ODC and the Department can identify the matter by date (approximately 2015–2017), court (First Circuit), presiding judge, parties, and charge (HRS § 231-86, Violent Interference with a Tax Official). The charge was initially dismissed due to a charging defect (mens rea omission, to my recollection) and later refiled. The matter proceeded to trial and ended in a **hung jury**. The July 2017 trial took place at 777 Punchbowl St, Honolulu, HI 96813 (Ka`ahumanu Hale). To my knowledge, the trial received no media coverage; my counsel at the time also expressed surprise at the absence of coverage.

### B. Murder threat reported during prosecution

During the pendency of that prosecution, I received an in-person murder threat from named individuals. I reported the threat to counsel. The enclosed ODC complaints provide a disciplined account of how counsel handled (or failed to handle) that report and related trial-integrity issues.

### C. Witness tampering (May/June 2017)

In **May or June 2017**, shortly before trial, I was approached outside **Kahala Whole Foods** by an individual I identify as **“Kevin” (surname known to me)**, associated with a North Shore social circle connected to the threat context. He threatened that my career would be destroyed if I continued speaking about the murder threat and related stalking/hacking.

This approach was specifically designed to prevent me from **testifying about the murder threat at the upcoming trial**—testimony that would have been directly relevant to state of mind, credibility, and context. The Department can evaluate whether this conduct implicates **18 U.S.C. § 1512**.

---

## VI. Exhaustion of state mechanisms (why a federal record pull is necessary)

I pursued available state channels. The outcomes have been jurisdictional declinations, procedural bars, or non-investigation:

* **Hawaiʻi Commission on Judicial Conduct** — declined jurisdiction over Judge Loo citing the 90-day post-service window and directed attorney-conduct issues to ODC (Vice Chair **Doris M. Ching** letter dated **June 26, 2025**, in my possession).
* **Hawaiʻi Ethics Commission** — claimed confusion over authority as to aspects of the matter.
* **HPD** — declined to investigate multiple reported felonies by McKinley despite filed reports and identified evidentiary sources.
* **ODC** — complaints filed [DATE] (enclosed); outcome pending.

This update is submitted because the central evidence is in **sealed records** and because the state-level accountability architecture has not produced an adjudication on the merits of the core allegations.

---

## VII. Evidence and records requested

### A. Records DOJ/FBI can obtain directly

1. The **sealed audio recording** of the December 2, 2022 hearing.
2. The sealed **court file**, including the text-message exhibit containing “I took the acid,” and any associated foundation testimony.
3. Minute entries, sealing order, and any clerk/judge notations relevant to the hearing.
4. Any HPD reports / incident numbers relating to McKinley (if needed for context).

### B. Materials I can provide promptly upon request

* Full identifying information for “Kevin” and details of the Kahala Whole Foods incident.
* The **June 26, 2025 Doris M. Ching letter** and other state correspondence.
* ODC filing proof and the complete ODC packet.
* HPD report numbers and a concise exhibit index for rapid retrieval.

### C. Documentation loss due to homelessness

Due to prolonged homelessness (2017–present, with brief interruptions), I lost certain records, including the case number for the VIWATO matter, correspondence, and some supporting documentation. I am prepared to assist the Department in locating records through institutional channels (court clerk, Attorney General's office) and will cooperate fully in reconstructing the evidentiary record.

---

## VIII. Requested action (narrow, actionable)

I respectfully request that the Department:

1. **Associate this filing** with my July 12, 2025 complaint as a superseding update with supplemental exhibits.
2. **Preserve and review** the sealed December 2, 2022 record (audio + file + exhibits + minute entries).
3. Determine whether the record supports inquiry under **18 U.S.C. §§ 1622, 1503, and 242**.
4. Evaluate whether the Kahala Whole Foods threat incident supports inquiry under **18 U.S.C. § 1512** (witness tampering), including interviewing me and obtaining any corroborating evidence available.
5. Evaluate whether the seal on the December 2, 2022 proceeding should be challenged under the crime-fraud exception. If the sealed record contains evidence of suborned perjury, obstruction, or deprivation of rights under color of law, the seal may function as an instrument of the alleged criminal conduct rather than protection of a legitimate interest. I request only that the Department assess this possibility based on the sealed record and applicable standards. I am not seeking a determination here, only an evaluation of whether unsealing should be pursued.

I am available for interview and will cooperate fully.

## IX. Declaration (28 U.S.C. § 1746)

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.
