Commission on Judicial Conduct  
The Judiciary, State of Hawai‘i  
417 S. King Street, Room 206A  
Honolulu, Hawai‘i 96813-2943  
Dear Mr. Dickson C. H. Lee, Chair, and Members of the Commission on Judicial Conduct,

I am writing in partial response to your letter dated March 13, 2025 (Re: 1DSS-22-0001008), and to bring additional matters to your attention for disclosure and clarification, in the public interest.

**Regarding Audrey L.E. Stanley:**

I understand the Commission's primary jurisdiction concerns the conduct of sitting judges. However, given that Ms. Audrey L.E. Stanley is currently listed as a First Circuit Per Diem Judge, I believe it is imperative to disclose for your records alleged actions undertaken by her during her tenure as a Public Defender. These allegations, detailed on the public record website GTCode.com, raise serious concerns about conduct that may be relevant to her current judicial capacity, even if they occurred prior to her appointment.

Specifically, as documented on GTCode.com in the "Timeline of Institutional Failures & Systematic Targeting" under the entry "2016 \- Day of Eddie Aikau Contest," it is alleged that:

1. "Public Defender Audrey Stanley was informed by author about the conspired, coordinated murder threat issued to author by Eugene and Rita Hartmann to deter author's investigation into the crimes by Klein associates."  
2. "Public Defender Audrey Stanley attempted extortion: relayed offer to 'drop charges' if author 'left the state'."

While these alleged actions occurred when Ms. Stanley was a Public Defender and not a judge, and thus may fall outside the Commission’s direct disciplinary jurisdiction for that period, I submit this information for disclosure and for your awareness, considering her current role as a Per Diem Judge. The integrity of the judiciary relies on the character and past conduct of its officers, and I believe this information is pertinent.

**Regarding Wilson M.N. Loo:**

Your letter dated March 13, 2025, states, "Wilson M. N. Loo is no longer a per diem judge as of July 2024\. Pursuant to Rule 8.2(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Hawai'i, the Commission has no jurisdiction to consider a complaint against any justice or judge if the submission is more than 90 days after the judge leaves office. This matter is now closed as the Commission no longer has jurisdiction to consider your February 2025 emails."

However, I wish to bring to your attention a discrepancy. As of today, 202505221715, the official Hawaiʻi State Judiciary website, under the section listing "First Circuit Per Diem Judges (Oahu)," continues to list "Wilson M.N. Loo" as an active per diem judge. (A copy of this list, as accessed on \[Insert Current Date\], can be provided if necessary, or is readily verifiable on the Judiciary's website).

This presents a contradiction. If Mr. Loo is indeed no longer a per diem judge as of July 2024, then the public-facing information provided by the Judiciary is inaccurate and misleading. If he is still an active per diem judge, then the Commission’s assertion regarding lack of jurisdiction based on his departure from office would appear to be based on incorrect information.

Could you please clarify this discrepancy regarding Mr. Loo's current judicial status? If he is no longer serving, I respectfully request that the Judiciary’s official records be updated to reflect this accurately. If he is still serving, then the basis for closing the file on jurisdictional grounds may need re-evaluation.

Thank you for your time and attention to these serious matters. I present this information in the public interest and for the integrity of the judicial system in Hawai'i. I look forward to your acknowledgement and clarification on the points raised.

Very truly yours,

Paul Lowndes
